the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals and almost the end of the season I thought of an idea where we look at all 30 teams and look at ten players that you may not have known or may have forgotten about who actually played for that certain team so obviously with the Raptors and warriors heading into game number six we're going to look at both the Raptors and the Warriors but in this video we're gonna look at the Warriors and in the next episode of this series we'll look at the Raptors but I want you guys to let me know which team you want after that and I think it's just a good way to get some NBA content when it's the offseason and there is no basketball anymore so that's the plan for this series and this series will be done when we've gone through all 30 NBA teams anyway before I get started if you like this idea let me know by hitting that like button also be sure to comment on which team you'd want me to do next so without further ado let's look at ten players who you may have forgotten about playing for the Golden State Warriors and let's see how many of these guys you get right and be honest in the comments section number 10 Ralph Sampson he's number 10 but many people don't realize that apart from being one of the top spots on the what could have been list and the Houston Rockets first overall pick in the 1983 NBA Draft it was also a part of the Golden State Warriors from 1987 to 1989 Samson's incredible size and unnatural agility for a man that was seven foot four is just insane he was able to burst on the NBA scene as a rookie averaging 21 points 11 rebounds two assists two and a half blocks per game in his first season he was also named an all-star and won the NBA Rookie of the Year award but he was injured halfway into the 1987-88 season which unfortunately was not uncommon for Sampson evident through his name being one that people just remember for what could have been with Hakeem Olajuwon after making the finals in 1986 the twin towers were meant to do big things but it just wasn't meant to be Samson's knee and back troubles worsened and he never played a full season in the remaining years of his career he was only able to average six point four points and rebounds with the Golden State Warriors in 1988-89 number nine Muggsy Bogues everyone loves Mugsy I mean how can you not love Mugsy Bogues people remember him for his time in Charlotte with Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning after all Boggs settled in Charlotte he established himself in Charlotte as an exceptional passer a great Steeler one of the fastest players on the court and a fan favorite Bowie spent ten years in Charlotte as a Hornet led by mourning and Johnson and they became one of the most popular teams in the NBA but Mugsy Bogues also played for the Golden State Warriors averaging 5.5 points and five assists as a warrior and then signed later as a free agent with the Raptors as we all know number eight Terry Cummings if you don't know who Terry Cummings is you should because in my opinion he's one of the most underrated players that I know of he's a top 50 scorer of all time he was a rookie of the year who averaged 23 points ten point four rebounds which is insane he was averaging 16.6 points and seven rebounds threes 17-year NBA career until he joined the Warriors in which he averaged nine points and five rebounds a game for his first season and then eight points and five rebounds in his last season before retiring he's obviously best known on his time with the box where he made the all-star team twice and obviously had a great career with the Spurs as well but many people forget or don't even know about him playing for the Golden State Warriors number seven Richard Jefferson this is one of those guys where we just think of him and remember his time in Cleveland because he won a championship beating the Warriors and it always seems a little bit weird seeing him in a Warriors jersey considering the cows warriors rivalry in the last few years was insane it's one that is just easy to forget he even played for them as the average less than five points in his time in Golden State in the end he was an integral part of the Cavaliers though who actually beat the Warriors despite being down three games to one the first team in NBA history to come back being down three games to one and Richard Jefferson even over 35 years old was a huge part in that team and a great player coming off the bench and his dunk on klay Thompson still insane number six Robert Parish obviously he was best known for his time at the Celtics he spent four seasons there and one for NBA championship with thanks to Larry Bird Kevin McHale and the rest of the team but it was also a part of the Warriors in fact they're the team that drafted him parish was drafted in the first round of the 1976 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors but at that time he had also been drafted by the Utah Stars in the 1973 ABA specialty and he was also drafted by the Spurs in the 1975 ABA draft as well don't ask me how that works just go with it Parrish signed with the Warriors in the end and the Warriors were NBA champions in 1975 two years prior to parish's rookie season campaign however when Parrish drawn the Warriors their decline began immediately they missed the entire players completely from 1978 to 1980 and then he became a member of the Boston Celtics number five John Starks okay so did you know that stars played for the Warriors if you did did you know he played for them twice in two different occasions although he was passed over in the 1988 NBA Draft Stark's signed with the Golden State Warriors in September of 1988 as a free agent this was his rookie year the thing is if you know the Golden State Warriors you know that the 1988 draft was a special one because they drafted shooting guard Mitch Richmond as well with the fifth overall pick which meant that Stark's played limited minutes in only 36 games while Richmond won Rookie of the Year but in the second cent with the Warriors in 1999 he averaged about 14 points and five assists and was actually pretty solid before he left number four Jamal Crawford because Jamal Crawford hasn't aged a day since joining the NBA in the year 2000 apart from a few more tattoos this image of him in a Warriors jersey almost looks photoshopped but it's not and to be honest there are actually attained that should be targeting him again next season Crawford only played in 54 games for the Warriors but he did start in all of them averaging nearly 20 points a game with 4.4 assists and 1.5 rebounds but because the Warriors did not qualify for the playoffs in the 2008 onine season they traded Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks the Warriors did go on to draft curry that year so I guess it turned out all right number three can I just mention one guy's name who I think is one of the most underrated of our era but nobody ever talks about anymore is Mark Price he was so good remember how I did the check on a pick a roll he created Mark Price has been known as one of the most underrated point guards of all time he's a four-time all-star he's a two-time NBA 3-point contest winner he's part of the 50-40-90 Club he's got his jersey retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers he was a really really good player he was obviously best known as a Cleveland Cavalier with four of his also appearances being with the Cavaliers and Mark Price actually revolutionized the way that people attack on the screen and roll he was the first guy who really split the screen role and everybody knew that if they were up against mark price it was gonna be a tough night because he was seriously good anyway he actually ended up on the Golden State Warriors in the 1996 1997 NBA season when he averaged 11 points and 5 assists with a steal per game he shot 90 percent from the free-throw line almost 40% from three and about 45 percent from the field so he was extremely efficient just as he was his entire career but I reckon a lot of people who never knew that price actually was a warrior at one point number two Nick Van Exel most will probably remember Nick Van Exel from his Laker days I mean this guy crossed up players had a smooth left hand jump shot but Van Exel also spent some time in Golden State as well in fact he spent 39 games there Van Exel was traded in August of 2003 to the Golden State Warriors during the Oh 304 season he played in a career low 39 games averaging 12 points 6 points and 5.3 assists but x'l was a veteran by the time he got to the Warriors having spent most of the late 90s with the Lakers and the early 2000 with the Nuggets and the Dallas Mavericks even before then obviously it was a big demotion for Van Exel as he went from a playoff contender with the Dallas Mavericks to a team that had the longest playoff drought in the NBA at the time which obviously that made Van axle kind of not wanna play for the Warriors considering he was almost about to win an NBA championship at least try to number one Chris Webber Chris Webber now you probably know about Chris Webber playing for the Warriors I mean he got drafted there he had a crazy move on Charles Barkley behind-the-back yamdoot in his face I mean we all know that the Orlando Magic passed up on Chris Webber and they chose Penny Hardaway instead pairing Shaq and Penny instead of Shaq and Webber but this isn't this time this isn't the 1993 rookie Chris Webber playing for the gone State Warriors this is the Golden State Warriors Chris Webber of the year 2008 15 years after he got drafted their Warriors fans are probably still upset over the fact that Webber did not play his prime using Dom state because he immediately after his rookie season left the team because he didn't like the coach anyway he finished where he started as he got drafted to go on state and retarding Golden State you only played nine games for the Warriors averaging three point nine points 3.6 rebounds in 40 minutes per game and that's it that's ten plays you may have forgotten about playing for the going to say warriors and with that said if you guys enjoyed this video please be sure to
