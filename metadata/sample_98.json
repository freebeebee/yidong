"the suarin was my was the primary central work of my father's secondary world one of the chief things that people know about it I think is that it was unfinished but I think this is in a way misleading uh the real point is is that there were several sarons when he was a very young man during the first world war and in the Years immediately following he wrote a work called The Book of lost Tales which the little notebooks that he used still exist Little Penny notebooks and some parts of it he recorded were written in the trenches under shelfire and this was the first Sil marilon and then he didn't then call call it that it's quite unlike his later manner of writing when he adopted a much more remote exalted even manner for his mythology it's more immediate it's even funny uh it's very written in an extraordinar flowery consciously archaic manner which I think is very attractive but there already in uh often in very early undeveloped forms are the great Stories the great Legends which were an inspiration to him throughout his life above all the uh the lay of Baron and luum and the tragedy of toin Tura another silmarilion was already in existence by about 1930 and that is very different it's as I say it's in a more remote style and it's uh it's more Chronicle like the important thing is that that was finished the book of lost Tales you could say was finished the 1930s of merilon was finished it's complete a completely enclosed myth not presupposing any later ages and at that stage The Hobbit had no connection with it in fact he said in a letter that he wrote in 1964 he said by the time the Hobbit appeared in 1937 this the sumilon was in coherent form The Hobbit was not intended to have anything to do with it I had the Habit while my children were still young of inventing and telling orally sometimes writing down children's stories in inverted con for their private Amusement The Hobbit was intended to be one of them it had no necessary connection with the Mythology by which he means with s but naturally became attracted towards this dominant Construction in my mind causing the tale to become larger and more heroic as it preceded even so it could really stand quite apart and so you see the uh the famous names of Middle Earth such as the Misty Mountains merkwood the Great River of wilderland they began with The Hobbit and had no necessary Association at all with the mythology as it existed at that time The Lord of the Rings was began as the sequel to The Hobbit but this dominant Construction in my mind as as he says attracted everything into it attracted The Hobbit and still more of course attracted the Lord of the Rings so the Lord of the Rings becomes in the most complex fashion both the sequel to The Hobbit and heavily involved with the suion I think one must say it was the last version of the sumilon that he couldn't finish he couldn't finish a s marilon uh that would stand in relation to the Lord of the Rings it was inevitable that the Lord of the Rings must alter the silmarilion because having once been as I've said an enclosed myth for the beginning and an end it now has the vast extension and in The Lord of the Rings there are major figures Who come out of the Elder days out of the the the Primeval world of the saril chief among them Galadriel so a great deal of writing back would have to be done but my father being who he was this writing back would never be a simple thing because he be when Galadriel enters out of The Lord of the Rings into the world of the elves in Valor new stories begin right up to the end of his life galadriel's position in the Elder days was still being developed so this was a a major problem but I think there were deeper problems than this I think that in his later years he became he had become detached in a way from the old Legends toin barin and so on and they were immensely important to him but they were think things that uh they were like the legends of the real world which he could which he could observe and study and he became more and more interested I think more and more more and more interested in the what I call the metaphysical aspects of the uh of his secondary invention above all with the nature of the elves because it is absolutely fundamental to the whole conception is that men are mortal and elves are Immortal and as he declared I'm sure rightly declared the the fundamental underpinning concern of all his work was death the intol toble fact and the nature of the elves going right back to the book of lost Tales was above all that they were Immortal they were not naturally destined to die they could be killed because they had bodies but they were not in their nature destined to die whereas men are of their nature destined to spend only a short while in the world where the life of the elves was coterminous with the life of ar ar being the Elish word for the world our world of which Middle Earth was a part and so in his later years he [Music] became involved in profound attempts to determine the nature of an immortal being who is nonetheless incarnate and possesses a body this would in turn was beginning to develop new stories within the Saron and I think the whole thing simply became too large too complex uh to have so precise to attempt to impose so precise a metaphysical explanation on it was perhaps a task for a younger man the flame began to die down and and he hadn't the energy left that would be needed for such a huge transformation some people who knew him well thought that he didn't really have said that he didn't really want to finish the zelion suggesting even that in at some level he felt that to finish the selion would be finishing his life I personally don't think that at all I don't think there's any real evidence for it I think he deeply wanted to finish it but cut too large too large a task to T", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1110, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:18.819",
