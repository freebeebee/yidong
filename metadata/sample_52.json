to the world's first emergency telephone&nbsp; number. But who knew that it was also home&nbsp;&nbsp; to the worlds first human cannonball?&nbsp; In today's episode of Unusual As Usual&nbsp;&nbsp; we\u2019re going to examine the explosive career of&nbsp; Zazel AKA The Human Cannonball of Westminster. Rossa Matilda Richter was born in 1863 in&nbsp; London, England. Her father, Ernst Richter,&nbsp;&nbsp; was a well known talent agent who supplied acts&nbsp; to several circus productions - her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp; Susanne Richter, was a dancer&nbsp; in one of these productions. Coming from a circus background&nbsp; it was no surprise when she took&nbsp;&nbsp; up aerial trapeze at the age of&nbsp; six, making her performance debut&nbsp;&nbsp; at the Garrick Theatre in Whitechapel&nbsp; under the stage name La Petite Lulu. As an accomplished tightrope and aerial&nbsp; acrobat Richter became known for her&nbsp;&nbsp; trademark \"leap-for-life\u201d trapeze stunt which she&nbsp; continued to perform throughout her career. When&nbsp;&nbsp; she was 12 she joined a traveling acrobat&nbsp; troupe who toured from Ireland to France.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was during this time that she became the&nbsp; prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of famed Canadian tightrope walker,&nbsp;&nbsp; William Leonard Hunt, also&nbsp; known as The Great Farini. Farini's feats included performing&nbsp; somersaults while on the wire,&nbsp;&nbsp; hanging from it by his feet, riding&nbsp; a bicycle across it as well as daring&nbsp;&nbsp; tight wire walks over Niagara Falls and&nbsp; other seemingly impossible manoeuvres. In 1871, several years before its first public&nbsp; display, he filed a patent in the US for&nbsp;&nbsp; \"certain new and useful Apparatus for Projecting&nbsp; Persons and Articles into or through the Air.\u201d Richter and Farini would work on this act&nbsp; together in secret until 2nd April 1877 when,&nbsp;&nbsp; the now 14-year-old Richter, changed her stage&nbsp; name to \"Zazel, the Beautiful Human Cannonball\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp; and publicly performed the stunt fir the&nbsp; first time at The Royal Aquarium, London. She was fired out of a large cannon, traveling&nbsp; through the air and landing in a net. In the&nbsp;&nbsp; book The Great Farini by Shane Peacock he writes&nbsp; \"Farini stood at the cannon, looking evil in his&nbsp;&nbsp; black beard, commanding the sweet, beautiful&nbsp; young Zazel to enter the mortar, then lighting&nbsp;&nbsp; the fuse to a great flourish, sending her across&nbsp; the great hall into a net of his own invention.\" In reality, the cannon used rubber springs to&nbsp; propel her, however explosives were attached to&nbsp;&nbsp; complete the full effect. Most sources,&nbsp; including the Guinness Book of Records,&nbsp;&nbsp; cite Zazel as the first human cannonball&nbsp; However, others claim that \"The Australian&nbsp;&nbsp; Marvels,\" Ella Zuila and George Loyal,&nbsp; had performed the act a few years earlier. Zazel was featured at The Royal Aquarium&nbsp; for an extended period of time, sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; performing twice a day, and often to sell out&nbsp; audiences. The Human Cannonball act quickly&nbsp;&nbsp; became a sensation and she took on celebrity&nbsp; status. Among her fans were King Edward 7th,&nbsp;&nbsp; who reportedly attended two of her&nbsp; performances when he was the Prince of Wales. An article in The Billboard by Louis Cooke&nbsp; reads \"the breathless silence that always&nbsp;&nbsp; preceded the act while it was being prepared&nbsp; only added to its intensity, and the graceful&nbsp;&nbsp; bow of the young lady who had the temerity&nbsp; and muscular strength to withstand the shock&nbsp;&nbsp; and presence of mind to guide her flight never&nbsp; failed to receive a round of rapturous applause.\u201d Zazel challenged stereotypes through acts that&nbsp; demonstrated feats of strength and agility,&nbsp;&nbsp; The human cannonball was not her only act. She&nbsp; also began performing a high dive at around&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time, also at The Royal Aquarium. For&nbsp; that stunt she would stand on a platform which&nbsp;&nbsp; was raised up to 97 feet, before jumping into a&nbsp; net below. She continued to walk the tightrope&nbsp;&nbsp; increasing the risk by running, laying down,&nbsp; standing on one foot and even sitting on the wire. These daring stunts did not come without their&nbsp; risks and in 1879 Zazel received her first&nbsp;&nbsp; human cannonball accident while performing&nbsp; at The Royal Aquarium, quickly followed by&nbsp;&nbsp; another in Portsmouth, where the net used to&nbsp; catch her was unsafe due to wear and tear. Although she didn't break any bones,&nbsp;&nbsp; the accidents were serious enough for her&nbsp; to take a short hiatus from performing. The human cannonball act is regarded as&nbsp; the most dangerous of all the aerial arts. The danger is due to the fact that the performer&nbsp; has far less control over their trajectory and&nbsp;&nbsp; movement. A traditional aerialist placed their&nbsp; faith in their strength and conditioning,&nbsp;&nbsp; but when it came to the human cannonball their&nbsp; faith was placed in mathematics over time,&nbsp;&nbsp; the spring loaded method of propulsion&nbsp; proved unreliable pushing modern human&nbsp;&nbsp; cannonball performers to use&nbsp; compressed air in their cannons. According to the great showman P.T. Barnum, who&nbsp; had traveled to London to see her performance,&nbsp;&nbsp; Zazel pleaded with him to take her away. She was&nbsp; upset at the small share of money she received&nbsp;&nbsp; from Farini when she was the star of the show&nbsp; and the one who took all the physical risks. In 1880, while the English Parliament&nbsp; debated the Acrobats and Gymnasts'&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill which proposed to ban all public&nbsp; displays of dangerous acts such Zazel's,&nbsp;&nbsp; she and Farini took their show out of the&nbsp; country. She performed with the Barnum &amp; Bailey&nbsp;&nbsp; Circus for one season, performing in&nbsp; France followed by the United States. Theres no doubt that being the first human&nbsp; cannonball meant Zazel subjected herself to&nbsp;&nbsp; the highest level of danger. It took some time but&nbsp; eventually the odds finally caught up with her,&nbsp;&nbsp; when in 1891, while performing her signature&nbsp; 'leap-for-life\u2019 trapeze stunt in Las Vegas,&nbsp;&nbsp; the inevitable happened. The bracing&nbsp; poles were supposed to be fastened&nbsp;&nbsp; together with steel cables, but they&nbsp; were accidentally left unsecured. When she swung out on the wire, the poles came&nbsp; apart and Zazel fell to the ground. She plummeted&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 feet to the ground below, completely&nbsp; missing her safety net - she survived,&nbsp;&nbsp; but broke her back in several places, an injury&nbsp; that effectively ended her circus career. She&nbsp;&nbsp; retired that year, aged 28, after spending several&nbsp; months in a suspended full body cast recovering. The following year she began using her&nbsp; expertise to advocate for the use of&nbsp;&nbsp; nets as life-saving tools, such as to catch&nbsp; people jumping out of burning buildings. To&nbsp;&nbsp; demonstrate their safety, dressed in normal&nbsp; clothing, including jewellery and a hat,&nbsp;&nbsp; she would throw herself out of the window&nbsp; of buildings and into what was called 'the&nbsp;&nbsp; Browder life net'. In addition to performing&nbsp; these publicity stunts, she also wrote on&nbsp;&nbsp; the subject becoming a column writer for The&nbsp; Evening Sun as a way to publicise her ideas. In reality the life nets&nbsp; often failed to save people,&nbsp;&nbsp; and sometimes firefighters themselves were&nbsp; injured or even killed by falling bodies. Leapers sometimes struck obstacles&nbsp; on the way down, landed on firemen,&nbsp;&nbsp; or missed the net entirely. This saving&nbsp; technique was eventually phased out in&nbsp;&nbsp; the 1960\u2019s and due to advances in firefighting&nbsp; technology, it became obsolete by the 1980s. Rossa Matilda Richter died of natural&nbsp; causes on the 8th December 1937, aged 74. And there we have it, the explosive career of the&nbsp; worlds first Human Cannonball - Zazel.
