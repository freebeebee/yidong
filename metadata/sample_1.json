trainer Assessor I have a caseload of learners and that are all based around the child care qualifications so most of them are doing childcare qualifications at level 2 and level 3 but we also deliver child care qualifications within things like schools after-school clubs play works also now we want our learners to progress so we're looking at things like when the learners have progressed and they've done their level two and level three how can we progress them and keep their training go away and keep them motivated carries our training assessor she's what she's always worked with us from for years she's always catered for all all my members of staff she informs me about everything that's happening regarding their end dates regarding the progress that they're making and if there's any any issues with the staff and she actually gives us more training opportunities so she suggests about first aid about food hygiene and she lets me know about safeguarding training as well which is really beneficial Carrie is my Assessor I see Carrie once a month it's normally the first week of the month so Vandor sick and she'll always come into the nursery and we do meetings that can look like one-to-one meetings that can last for an hour up to two hours or however long it takes so it's really rewarding being a training Assessor I like how you get to see the learner journey so throughout them starting their apprenticeship coming to you coming to us a lot of them come to me straight from school and then getting to see them how they progress how they develop their confidence becoming a really competent member of the team if I need to talk to Carrie in between the time gaps I've got a work number and stuff or email address so if I've got any problems or inquiries or question anything like I can just message her and she'll get back to me as soon as she can with the best answer to help there was there was one time with Carrie when a member of staff was worried about our end date and she really needed to finish a level free to get College because she wanted to go to university so Kari actually spent a lot of time she come a few months a few visits that month and got the the girl signed off and she got to go to university on time so we really did appreciate that at that time so did the girl so inter-service developed me quite quite a lot really I started off in the company as a trainer Assessor so I didn't have my assessment qualification when I started so I did my training all through inter serve and they trained me to become an Assessor so if someone else was looking at becoming a trainer Assessor I'd say that it was a great career opportunity there's lots of the things that I like about it is that there's lots of career opportunities that go with it as well so you you don't just come into it and stay as a trainer Assessor there's lots of that career ladder that you can progress and move up to so it would be it's a really good kind of career move to go into it's really enjoyable you see something different every day there's lots of variety within the job role as well and you're out and about lots of times so it's seeing lots of different things recommended in serve as well I can speak from personal experience because Kari actually was my Assessor and she she's helped me do my level four which is my childcare qualification and I was looking into doing assessing actually so she suggested doing the TAC reward so she actually trained me on my TAC reward which was very successful I got it done in six months and then actually Kari was the one who recommended me to my level five so my kindly my company did fund me for it and Kari we got my level 5 completed in a year so I was really happy with everything and that's why I always recommend and served everybody", "text_to_speech_word_count": 715, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:03.737", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " Tewsyd Roiwn\uc988"}, {"end": "00:00:08.976", "start":
