Jefferson was one of the best role players on a pretty stacked Cleveland team I mean he's part of the team that seems as though they'll advance to the NBA Finals for the third straight year and he's still super productive a really super productive bench player even at his age of 36 years old now once upon a time RJ was not like that he was a high flyer I mean we see glimpses of it now we saw a group glimpse of it against the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day a few months ago but he used to do it all the time he throw down me dunk after me dunk and there was one of the better small Falls in the league his time in New Jersey with Vince Carter was insane simply because well I'm sure you can either remind yourself or just imagine how good these guys were together and how fun they were to watch two of the better dunkers in the league playing together and winning games at the same time that's pretty cool but we're actually going to talk about another teammate appear Kenyon Martin and to be honest with you if you want to talk about somebody else who can throw it down Kmart was pretty good at doing that himself even though he was a big man his hops were pre insane now although Jefferson never made it to an all-star team in his career he still did average at least 19 points in for his first eight years in the league and as one of the key pieces on a dynamic New Jersey Nets team which I still think it's complete snub that he's never made it to at least one all-star team Kenyon Martin on the other hand made one but what was super sweet actual teams of these two played in it didn't matter who was an all-star how great these guys were it was two teams that they played him it was a team which made two straight NBA Finals appearances at the start of his career things still cause it included Jefferson Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin amongst other players despite how good the team was there normally is a little bit of beef in every team it happens it's just part of the sport I mean the most common known ones are obviously Kobe Shaq we know the Ray Allen and Rondo had their moments Barkley and Pippen just to name a few it happens and sometimes it's not even because they actually hate each other it's just the heat at the moment which is exactly what happened to Jefferson and Kenyon Martin except it's actually stated that it started during MBA game which is pretty crazy so Richard Jefferson found himself in a situation that no one wants to find themselves in not only brawling with another teammate but brawling with Kenyon Martin who to be fair is a pretty intimidating guy and with Richard Jefferson having a voice like this it's pretty funny to think about we talked a lot before the game coach did Marvin Jim did about the fact that this open style often seem to be shooting you and Antoine right do you like this is this something that you feel really comfortable in no I love it because it makes it tougher for the defense you're moving around it takes a lot of steam out of their office if they have to chase you around so the only thing is you got to get in shape and you know right now playing these amount of minutes and moving around to where we are you do get busy but later in the season I think it'll help what's even more funny is that the actual fight started because of another player on the other team bonzi Wells Jefferson said and I quote towards the end of the game me and Bosley wells are kind of getting into it Kenya is at the bottom of the free-throw line and the referee tells Kenyon tell your rookie to be quiet because I don't wanna get my technical dis late into the game Kenyon tells me how Richard be quiet Monty goes yes listen to Kenyon shut up I just lose it I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bonsly and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you too Kenyon I go sit down I'm mad pissed off I'm sitting down and Kenyon comes over in the locker room pissed off as well I stand up and he pushing me down on my seat we have a full-on fist fight the only thing that saved me is our millions and you remember how big he was grabbed him from the back and tried to calm him down while I swing hit Aaron Williams in his lip and bust his lip open at that point in time I realized what's going on I have no problem fighting Kenyon Aaron I don't want any piece of even with that fist fight right there we both understood how much we wanted to win and with that we were willing to fight anybody including each other to get that done yeah it's probably not the best idea and might have made sure to let him know about it after the team returned to the locker room that night but it does prove that they wanted to win and although they never want to ring with this one true finals appearances ain't bad at all according to Jefferson as well this incident didn't fracture the team instead brought them closer together so while teammates punching each other is just another wild story the fact that Jefferson to this day has no fear about going toe-to-toe with Martin one of the baddest dudes in the game maybe even more outstanding but as Jefferson says despite suffice both he and Martin share a common goal of just wanting to win and at all cost and sometimes things just reach a boiling point and I hope you guys enjoy the video if you enjoyed it it will be so awesome if you guys to subscribe just to show support and if we could hit 3000 likes that would be amazing as well I also want to say that if you guys have any video suggestions that you want me to make a video on let me know down below in the comment section and
