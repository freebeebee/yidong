defeat every Kung Fu Master that ever existed and add them to his collection throughout all of Kung Fu Panda there's been two extremely powerful villains tyong and Lord Shen tyong being this noow leopard which grew so powerful causing ugu himself to have to step in and stop him from destroying the valley Lord Shen The Mastermind who using his army was able to conquer it all of China but neither of these compare to one particular villain General Kai appearing in the physical world after being locked in the spirit realm for over 500 years his hunt to take over China begins now with Kai being the only villain we've seen owning the ability to manipulate Chi but not just in any normal way he spent the last 500 years inside the spirit realm defeating and stealing the chi from each Master creating his own Army of zombies releasing these so jomes into the world with one simple goal to find the dragon warrior the jomes appearing at the Jade Palace with each jomie possessing the strength to fight off one of the furious five and even hold back po eventually Kai taking control of zombies telling the furious five and po that he is Kai warning them that he has returned with Master Shifu discovering his scroll expecting this General Kai just to be some empty threat but Kai's backstory is something far beyond an empty threat with Kai being what was considered to be ugu's brother than fighting together for years upon years becoming Warlords both learning how to control Chi but with General Kai learning to steal Chi he gradually becomes more corrupted and evil causing ugu to banish him to the spirit realm but when ugu passes away into the spirit realm Kai is there to greet him easily overpowering every Master ever to exist stealing each Master Chi and adding them to his own Army and now this terrifying Beast is after the Dragon Warrior within only a few days of K's arrival every Master throughout all of China is gone each being defeated by Kai himself adding to his collection now all that Kai needs to do is steal the dragon Warrior's CHI with both Crane and mantis confronting General Kai himself but his Aura alone is enough to defeat both of them now traveling to the Jade Palace to defeat the rest of the Furious 5 and Mar Shifu confronting them all it's now 4 verse1 cly showing why he's simply the strongest easily overpowering the entire group without using any Chi abilities after stealing the chi of the rest of the Furious 5 and Master Shifu Tigress is the only one standing left running to warn po of the danger that's on its way the immortal God General Kai with po setting up a plan in the secret Panda Village to defeat Kai going through hours upon hours training assigning groups to the pandas giving Specialties essentially forming the perfect plan ready for any time that Kai arrives suddenly the presence of the village is completely shook the sky changes and everyone is in Terror the mere presence of General Kai is enough to put Terror into the souls of Mortals Kai releasing his army of zombies the fight begins with Po's plan at the beginning proving pretty effective following through an intense fight between Po's trained Army and the jombies eventually defeating majority of the jombies PO getting a lock onto Kai's finger theing has planed to send him back to the spirit realm using the woy finger hold but it simply doesn't work everything po has planned up until now is all pointless revealing something that makes Kai easily the strongest villain throughout all of Kung Fu Panda history due to the fact that he's a spirit Warrior he's completely Immortal to physical Force the only way for someone to actually harm or defeat Kai is to become a Chi Master and use Chi to fight him with Kai proving to be Way Beyond all the Physical Realm causing the Dragon Warrior to only have one option left wrapping himself around Kai and taking them both to the spirit realm with Kai being completely enraged throwing po around easily overpowering him bringing the fight to a point where it's similar to a god tossing a mid doll around but while Kai is about to finish stealing off POS Chi a one in a million chance happens all the other Pand is tapping into their past and accessing the entire knowledge of chi instantaneously turning po into aqi Master giving po out of veral power yeah the spirit realm goes crazy on Po's behalf but General Kai isn't done yet using all his power maintaining a fight against the Chi Master eventually being overpowered locked away in the spirit realm again but this time none of it was for waste with every mon in history now being empowered by POS Chi they're all left in the spirit realm for K to hunt down leaving Kai with the potential to become even more powerful to the point that not even po himself can handle overall Kai scaling to multi-continental as he's able to easily break through ugu's barriers and use jombies such as tyong and ugu to create life scaled attacks with their CH power and speeds being scaled to high Hypersonic plus as Kai is able to travel throughout multiple dimensions on his own so I guess Cony Panda wasn't really just some kid series this whole time it's something even greater a dimensional battle between the strongest of the strongest we'll just have to wait and see who comes out on top let me know in the comments who you guys want me to scale next or even what characters I should put up against each other in a fight subscribe see you", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1005, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:01.000",
