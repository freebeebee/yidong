all want to be great players we want to have fancy skills but you need to start somewhere in this video I'm going to show you soccer drills for beginners [Music] artless of your age if you're just getting started in soccer you're a total beginner I would recommend that you start with fundamental skills so I'm gonna give you a few drills that are easy to get started with they'll help you build a little bit of confidence on the ball number one is footwork drills so you've all seen this a hundred times but start here build confidence using both feet next I would move into a little more advanced these are still drills that I do all the time and in reality a lot of advanced players that get away from fundamentals or they think they're too good for fundamentals and they're really missing out on some valuable development their technical skills could be a lot better if they didn't think that they needed complex advanced drills do the basics do them very well so coming back to footwork doing some of these inside outside touches bending knees getting low to the ground working with both feet so let's talk about that for a second don't wait until you've played ten years to start working on your weak foot work on both feet use both feet from the very beginning you will thank yourself that you did this and whatever point in your career that you're at right now adopt the mentality if I do ten shots with my right I'm gonna do ten shots with my left so fundamentals whatever footwork next I would do is some dribbling drills basic turning dribbling with the ball turning focus on getting lower the ground nice touches you can use inside a foot outside the foot that's where I would start and again with both feet focusing on the touches but also movement of the body and everyone makes mistakes if you do especially as a beginner just go again okay but getting low to the ground inside touches outside focusing on turning inside and outside of foot the next soccer drill I would have you practice is juggling so obviously this is the goal nice comfortable coffin and juggling but realistically if you've just started that is a struggle so what you want to do is start kicking catch focus on getting good backspin on the ball focus on getting a nice strong touch probably struggling to get enough power on the ball it's probably dying down here so in the beginning it's better for you to have a touch that's way too heavy than a touch that's not strong enough so focus on flexing that foot curling your toes getting under the ball creating good backspin on the ball you don't want it to go to the side you don't want it to go forward if anything have it come into yourself so at least you can control it okay but start with the kick and catch once you're comfortable not you developed confidence and actually flexing your foot and getting a good strong touch you can do a double you can do a left right or a right left but then you want to move into actually juggling trying to keep the ball up as many times as you can and maybe today your record is four but that's where you start tomorrow you want to make it five the next day you want to do six or beat your record every single day use it as a way to challenge yourself and to actually see if you're progressing with your ball control with your basic fundamental skills so don't get frustrated if you make a mistake I know it can be very frustrating as a beginner when you see other people juggling the ball and it looks so easy for them but realistically you don't deserve to have those skills yet because you haven't put in the time they have but you will get the skills just put in the practice if you make mistakes don't get frustrated just pick the ball up again go again think about what you're doing wrong what you can do better next time the next fundamental skill that you need to practice as a beginner is ball striking so ball striking can be shooting and it can also mean passing you need to practice both and you need to practice with both feet from the beginning now getting a ball and shooting it into a net is fantastic but I want to show you a better way to practice as a beginner as a beginner has any player realistically the way you're going to improve faster is with more repetitions obviously you have to add a wall it passes it back to me every time I'm practicing on the field if I have one Bowl I kick Internet then I run back and then I go again take another shot you're getting two shots in the time that you would get 20 shots with the wall so they're not trying to blast the ball as hard as you catch what you're focusing on this good technique [Applause] [Music] hey your wall is your best friend when you want to get better as a beginner [Music] you", "text_to_speech_word_count":
