Smart ties Jones being traded for each other and now we got Chris Paul being a a Golden State Warrior this hit us 12 minutes ago that's how quick we get to the basement we start to film 12 minutes ago and we find out the real details is a 20 30 first round pick that is protected it is a 2027 second round pick it is Jordan Poole and it is Ryan Rollins that is the cost of of Chris Paul I don't know how to feel now again this happened to a minute ago I haven't looked at no forms I ain't even looked at Twitter other than seeing Shams as post right I if I am a Warriors fan I am very skeptical of this man I this is is this the first this is the first move of Mike Dunleavy Juniors is tenure as the guy over there after this is not a Bob Myers move I'll say that right up front this is not a Bob Myers move you traded a young 24-ish year old player for a guy that might be uh well he's on the last leg we watched Chris Paul last season y'all know Chris Paul is my favorite player of all time I like this from the Chris Paul perspective he gets another opportunity to potentially win a championship that elusive NBA championship he's playing for a team that's got a lot of those in recent history but you trade this young player and I think actually I think this might showcase that there's a disconnect between the value as us NBA fans might see where Jordan pool versus what the front office of people because four years 140 million dollars even in the moment if you go watch those videos we're talking about these extensions between him Tyler hero I think Anthony Simon signed four-year 100 million Which is less than that obviously um we were like man this is a lot of money this is a lot of money um and here we go a year and two and not even I don't even think the contract starts this year so that 440 is going to Washington right now and you might have thought that the the cost or the the value of Jordan pool will be a lot higher than Chris Paul but obviously it's what Chris Paul was about to get waived two weeks ago and you oh man I just okay take a step back this is a lot of rambling out of that if there's one positive of this from the Warrior's perspective or or my perspective as a non-warrior fan is that we're about to see the the one thing that made me become a real Steph Curry fan was the movement off the ball and now that they have an additional playmaker with Chris Paul we're about to see a lot a lot of off ball Steph Curry and that's going to be dangerous for the league but on the other side of things you'll have six foot Chris Paul six couple six foot three Steph Curry when those dudes are on the court together it might be a struggle at that perimeter defense thing you know what I'm saying the first move of Mike Dunleavy Junior's tenure man and I oh I just don't I just don't know how to feel Wizards fans get their first round pick after not getting one for Bradley Beal the Chris that's forzingis it was for Chris Paul this is how weird the NBA is this off season is already going crazy with this trade going down and uh now you get Jordan pool if I'm the Wizards fans I feel really good about this because it's over the next four years of Jordan pool's career there's no real world we're about to be right back and take attention so even if it turns out to be a bad contract or Jordan pool doesn't hit the next step that maybe you believe he could potentially do you still got to hit a salary floor you still got to pay people and why not take a chance on the dude that we saw a couple years ago be really really good I mean Jordan pool is a quality NBA player with potential attached to them and you you didn't give up anything that you cared about you were trading or waving Chris Paul regardless Wizards fan so you take this a stride now does this I hope that this doesn't change their their philosophy when it comes to the draft in a couple hours because I don't want them to pass up on another guard if they believe that that guard is the real deal in a couple Seasons but now we got Jordan Poole and Titus Jones we don't need another guard so let's reach for a small forward a pal forward a senior center draft the best player available in your eyes and let the rest fall into play because this is no such thing as an untreatable contract even if Jordan pool doesn't turn out to be the player they you want him to be I don't know how this looks this does Chris Paul become now this super six-man point guard um in the mode of what Jordan pool was doing coming off the bench because I can't I don't see it being great to start off with all of those dudes together on the court um but if we keep the Steph Curry Clay Thompson Wiggins Draymond loon dog line up to start off with that's dope and now we can see this third stretch of Chris Paul's career because he's going through a lot he's going through the years where he was one of the best in basketball do not forget that he was fourth in MVP in like his third year of his career don't you forget I know you only remember the last couple years of Chris Paul when he ain't been all that he was like that and then once he ended up getting traded to OKC I thought that was like the second portion of his career where he's more of a vet can also still perform obviously he made an All-Star appearance then and then now he might be transitioning to a dude that comes off your bench to give you high quality minutes um Off the Bench but this is a high price to pay for potentially just a one-year rental um we cannot ignore the fact that Draymond Green punched the hell out of Jordan pool about a year or so ago um so that probably plays the part it's like yeah we just we just want to wash our hands of that relationship and I wouldn't be surprised if Jordan Poole was in the air when we were in the NBA finals and Draymond Green was doing his podcast on the BR app he had Steve Kerr one of the episodes and Steve Kerr was saying we like he was praising the Denver Nuggets about all of their players buying in and not complaining about the situation mostly talk about how like Christian brown brown and Bruce brown spot minutes and particular series but we got to the finals though dudes play great minutes and basically throwing shots that the young players on his team they say like they complaining a lot and see like they complaining a lot this I don't this just doesn't feel like a move that Bob Myers would have done last year again we can't just keep comparing it to Bob Myers but he it hasn't been that long since he left you know what I'm saying um so I'm very interested to see what else happens with the Warriors because there's rumors about kaminga as well I I would be I would be very pressed if I was a Warriors fan and we decided to trade the entire future for this one last dance and listen Steph Curry deserves it like I've made videos on this channel that you need to buy into Steph Curry while you can because he's still a top five three to five player in the NBA like he's still that good and they've tried to do this Balancing Act of we're gonna develop this young talent and Usher those dudes in and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond start to climb and even though they won a championship while doing that those younger players that you wanted to build up didn't play kamiga didn't play Moses Moody played a little bit in that title run um uh uh Jordan Poole played in that title run but for the most part those younger dudes didn't really get that moment didn't really get it I would be very very surprised if they decided to clean house of all of the young talent in order to compete for a couple more seasons because I do believe that you want to eventually Usher some of those in them and maybe uh maybe Mike Dunleavy is saying hey the guys that y'all drafted here I don't mess with I don't think that coming Jordan pool Moses Moody all the others Ryan Rollins are the guys that can be the next chapter so you know what we're gonna ship them out right now where they got value like I saw a report that the Indiana Pacers are involved with coming or interested in comminga is it true we'll see in a couple hours but this tray on surface level though I'm giving the Wizards like a straight up a I know again it's a lot of money to Jordan pool but like what what else are you you're paying you're not gonna pay kuzma right you're not right right hey they might try to bring kuzma back and I ain't gonna lie to you um but you just have money that you need to spend so why not take a chance on this dude and again in a couple years down the line if it don't work out you can flip them again and you got a first round pick for a dude that you didn't really care about to keep on the team Chris Paul would say like hey I'm standing on the west coast regardless Washington east coast you know what I'm saying um but for the Warriors I this trade is one of the ones that I need to see it on court first before I really feel about my initial gut reaction to this trade from the Warriors perspective is I don't really like it but then again Steph Curry and Clay moving because there's another guy that could get him into their spots I'm excited about that part but again with the idea of winning another championship Chris Paul is not in a position of need um but but oh oh hold on Chris Hayes hold on live the Golden State Warriors when I wave Chris Paul and is looking forward to partnering with the star to make a championship run was that even a question well this trade broke I didn't think oh they gonna wave him and do hello um all right let me know what you think Warriors fans please please let me know uh yeah y'all haven't done y'all don't do big trades like this this is not this is not in y'all DNA this is not what y'all normally do uh so I'm curious to see what you think and man", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1965, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:04.938", "start":
