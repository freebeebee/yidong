just the 24th best team defense the Celtics currently have the best offensive rating of all time on Saturday without Jalen Brown Malcolm Brogden and Al Horford the Seas picked up a gritty Road W in Motor City the Celtics sixth straight win saw the all business Jason Tatum post his fourth consecutive game of scoring 30 plus points by exposing whichever less experienced matchup that was put in his vicinity Tatum's resembled at the very least a top three to five player in this young season and if the Celtics can maintain their position near the top of the East he could very well take home his first MVP trophy against the Troy it Grant Williams and Blake Griffin stepped up in the absence of two crucial front Court players in brown and Horford Williams and Griffin have played key roles next to JT in the Celtics blistering start many fans don't take Boston seriously because Milwaukee took them to seven without Chris Middleton but at the end of the day you play who's in front of you Middleton quite simply has to be more durable for Milwaukee because there's no excuses come the playoffs the Bucks have started 10-2 this year all without Middleton so minus cash that proves Milwaukee is still damn tough to beat in terms of the Celtics though last year the momentum from Boston's historic mid-season turnaround carried over to a breakout playoff run Boston deserves respect for 2022's run regardless of the circumstances in terms of Milwaukee's Health with a few less lazy turnovers who knows Boston could have been celebrating Championship number 18 all summer instead Boston had to deal with the infamous IMEI udoku drama but that hasn't distracted them whether it's new coach Joe mozulla AKA nacho Varga Jason Tatum or this well-built Boston team they're all on a mission in 2023 the Celtics as a whole are very worrisome because of that this video delves into whether or not it's seeming like Beantown can finish the job right quick just 7.9 percent of you are subscribed so hit the sub box and turn on notifications hit the like button to help this video spread and last but not least my handle on Instagram and Twitter is at D flow Hoops so go help your Royal by following me there I'm really trying to get my numbers up on both those platforms so a follow would be greatly appreciated again that's at D flow Hoops on Instagram and Twitter back to the content Boston's right on the heels of the first place Milwaukee Bucks for the top spot in the Eastern Conference but I wanted to lead off this video by quickly flashing back to the 2022 playoffs after the Celtics swept Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in four hard-fought wins of round one I predicted they'd win the title while I got torched in the comment section after they didn't the prediction of Boston winning the chip on this channel didn't turn out as bad for me as this guy who tattooed the Celtics 2022 Championship Banner on his arm but it still stung for me my prediction about why Boston would win the title was based off the top heavy Firepower provided by Tatum and brown along with the Celtics stack depth around the Jays being surrounded with the perfect complementary weapons the time Lord's Rim protection Derek White's pure point guard organization Marcus Smart's top of the league perimeter defense and the toughness plus floor spacing up front from Big Al Horford and the Batman Robert Williams made me comfortable with picking the Celtics to win it all but the Celtics have the entirety of their core back intact this year in an attempt to run it back in 2023 in fact the addition of 50 40 90 Club member and former rookie of the year Malcolm Brogden who's currently out with hamstring tightness makes Boston even more top-heavy in terms of role players amidst the IMEI udoka drama beloved GM Brad Stevens also gave the team a boost in that area from the growth of wing sniper Sam Hauser who's making an elite 45 percent of his three-pointers to the draft steal of third string guard JD Davison or the signings of well-suited big body rebounding screen Setters in Noah vonlei and Blake Griffin this is now a much deeper Celtics team we'll get to a breakdown of Blake Griffin as well as the Celtics hottest three-point shooter this season but while the depth is outstanding Boston will go as far as Jason Tatum takes them just look at how Steph carried the Warriors offensively to steal the championship away from Boston the NBA is a superstar driven League it always has been and it always will be that's why Tatum's isolation bucket getting somehow reaching an even better level this season is the biggest storyline in Celtics land the best combo forward the game has to offer is currently third in points per game at 32.3 only behind Curry and doncic speaking to how efficient Jason's been so far at his position Tatum's 65.3 percent true shooting clip is only worse than Mikhail Bridges and boyon bogdanovic yet he averages 12 to 15 points more than those two the only 30 plus Point per game score who owns a higher true shooting percentage than Jason Tatum is Stephen Curry Jason's season-high 43 piece over the bottom feeding Pistons was a sight to behold he shot 14 for 28 from a few Fields knocked down seven of his 14 three-pointers and eight of his ten free throws along with dropping 43 he stuffed the stat sheet with 10 boards three dimes a block and a steal in a hefty 41 minutes of action unfazed by not having the second best player on this team and the best second option in all of basketball next to him in Jalen Brown Tatum was dominant in a variety of aspects as I said in my last video on him you almost never saw Jason playing like a traditional stretch big in imayudoku's system last season but he's been slipping and popping cranes like he does right here quite often under Coach Joe mozulla displaying Jason's perimeter defense his top foot is attacked quickly by Sadiq Bay but a quick under control recovery allows him to stay on Bay's hip as he drives and he pins his shot off the backboard then he takes it coast to coast and watch the slippery hesitation to freeze Michigan product Isaiah livers opening up a driving lane for his quick first step to take over being aware of Tatum's shooting range savvy play right here from Derek white to turn his body for the two-handed shuffle pass to the trailer and in one motion Shield off livers while slipping to the hoop to get Frenchman Killian Hayes out of the way for a 24-foot spot up three a triple cross-screen action with off-ball picks set by smart Griffin and white gets the Deep Bay sliding out of position and livers is forced to pick up but Tatum's patented leaning back fade gives him even more space than the picks already provided with a minute left in the half there's no excuse for beef stew to get beat up the floor like this but it just goes to show how Tatum's stamina has improved again late in the half with the Pistons drained Tatum pushes it up at 100 miles per hour through two Defenders and a crossover gets all four trailing piston Defenders thinking about another attack to the bucket before Tatum throws a left-handed Bullet to the right wing and credit to Marcus Smart for calmly knocking it down under the beef stew closeout first play of half number two sees Tatum set a weak side brush screen for Sam Hauser and pop this gets Tatum and ISO where he Sandwiches an inverted jab step with two normal Triple Threat moves before using his standing reach advantage over Bach donovich to drain a contested jumper look at the Celtics floor spacing on this possession with five Shooters on the court as this time Jason gets the dho from Batman forcing the switch on to Jaden Ivy and with Sadiq Bay helping watch the beautiful spin back to his strong hand watch the evasive triple between the legs size up leading to simultaneous jab step and jumper this time in a screen and roll with Von lay a spin move in the opposite direction of the screen breaks Diablo's ankles give credits of vonlea for still getting in there to make contact on his screen and an ambidextrous offhanded Euro Step gets Tatum the bucket in a semi-transition opportunity with the Piston scrambling Tatum gets Jaden ivy on an island and simply jab steps and like he did to Bogey shoots right over the top of him then hits him with the two small celebration signature play of the night for Boston was Marcus Smart getting back for this steal and saving the ball from going out of bounds which somehow results in an outlet to Tatum who lobs it up for Grant will Showtime Celtics right there Grant Williams is proving to be one of the game's best role players as he's leading the team in three-point percentage while being third best in the entire league in that area Batman's number one in the entire NBA in true shooting at 78.3 percent and since entering the starting lineup he's averaging 9.8 points 5.8 boards and two and a half dimes Blake Griffin's a fairly solid backup for Grant as while many were saying that BG's time in the league had come and gone Griffin was getting into the best shape of his career of course he's not the same athlete that he once was but Griffin looks skinnier than he's ever been last year Blake was tied with Kevin Love for the league lead and charges drawn with 26 of them he hasn't been doing a ton of that charge drawn this year but the stats show you that Griffin still has some juice left in the tank over his last four outings in just 13 and a half minutes per night the newest Celtic in Blake is posting 5.8 points and 3.3 boards on 53.3 percent shooting from the floor 50 shooting from deep and 100 from the line given I'm a raptor fan should I be worried about the Celtics should any non-celtic fan be worried about the Celtics best answer Down Below in the comments gets next video shout out in the top 5 commenters by December 21st earn free merchandise of their choosing today's speaks winners are firstly Stephen Perkins who says Anthony Lam is a big surprise to me if he can play like he did in this one he's going to be a critical contributor and secondly to Boston haltain who says matheran really reminds me of a young Ray Allen he's an elite three level scorer already with solid Vision who hustles hard on defense he's got supreme confidence like Alan and he's not scared of the big moment both Milwaukee Seattle Ray and matherine have great Hops and underrated finishing ability I can see him in Halliburton leading this Pacers team to deep runs in the future thanks for watching have a good one foreign [Music]",
