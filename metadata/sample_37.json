made the videos we've we've changed into more training now okay which that seems over the past year um the focus has been a lot more on the training side than anything else for juster TV um was we've gone more from information and training and you know how to get ahead to just really the the hardcore training with exact mate your exact mate you know your certif trainer now with exact mate um you've got your FastTrack deployment that is seems to be just really taken off well and so where do you go from here what's next I mean do you do you uh are you working on anything else you see anything else in the Horizon that that you might be deal you're thinking about jumping into and and tackling or are you going to ride this wave for a while and then figure it out later yeah great question and I will T to kind of put all that together everything that we've done in the past we still do for the most part right so the the the free stuff that goes out a lot of the stuff I talk about it's in my training right um the adjust your TV plus which is a subscription platform with exact mate level one and two symbility exact mate mobile bunch of scoping like in the field with the camera guy following us over me and Guy gr from veteran adjusting School a bunch of scoping videos a whole bunch of different perils um it's it's it was a lot of it's a lot of fun to to build adjuster TV plus and have it be a place where you know an adjuster can get can watch stuff right you can you can watch the way adjusters do it like experienced adjusters do it we have construction videos in there how do a roof go on and or come off like the old roof go come off and the old the new one goes on right all that stuff is in there and then FasTrack to deployment is it's half for the adjuster and it's the other half is for the I firms and the and really the industry so that's the kind of the final piece that I put everything that I that I know as an adjuster and everything that worked really really well for me that I feel tested and that when I when I with train adjusters the learning you know the mistakes that I made and the things that I learned when I had other people with me you know that I was teaching um all that stuff has been refined into adjust or into FasTrack deployment which is it'll be 2 years old so in J June or July um and it's basically a way for me to say all right here's this systemized framework for the whole claims process start start to finish and then I'm going to test you on whether that made that clicked with you or not right and then when I'm satisfied that you've got it right this is the best thing I could come up with short of like opening an adjuster School um then I'm handing you off to my partner I firms who have agreed to say Matt we trust you we trust that you know that when you say that this person's ready to go they're actually ready to go and we'll take it from there we're going to try to FASTT trck them which is why we call it fast trck to the front of the line for deployments where they can send new people right um so you get priority on boarding right with them and so I'm helping them sort out the the the the the jewels the diamond out of all the Warm Bodies that's that's really what FASTT track to deployment is is a way for me to help vet people um and it's you know it's priced accordingly and it is there's a lot of support with it there's it's it's all self-paced right FasTrack but there's a there's a weekly live live stream that we do Q&amp;A and I do additional I've done so many additional trainings in there that I could have like five more modules to add to fast trck but they're all in the same anyway so that's that's really the whole totality of Ajer TV in a nutshell like kind of how we generate revenue and what we're doing for the industry as far as like what's in the future I I think that we are at the point now where I've got something that really really helps the IIA firms I've got something that really really helps the the adjusters and now we're trying to this at this point we're trying to get feedback we're trying to optimize we'll cut things out where it needs to be cut out we'll add things in where things are outdated or they don't need to be in there anymore and continue to add more partner firms we have nine now uh in that program and uh really just like for lack of a better like analogy just pouring gas on on the fire we've got right so um definitely adding in smaller trainings like we got a level three coming up for exact toate um there's going to be there's more exact toate mobile like sort of like Hands-On like workflow processed stuff versus like the nuts and bolts of exact mate mobile we've already got that in there locked in um want to get more symbility stuff in there as well so it's but but nothing like no new like giant courses or like conferences or you know anything else like that so what does it actually look like when adjusters with Decades of experience between them scope a hail damaged house on video what about how to actually do a claim in Xactimate what is simility and how do you even get started in it what if there was one place one huge and expanding library of property claim suggesting videos showing how it's done what if there were also complete Xactimate certifications as well as the latest and most up-to-date exact mate mobile training you know what if what if the dream was a reality get started for free binging all the desk and field claims adjusting videos you can stand right now at adjuster TV plus.com think of it as a virtual Ride Along speaking of ride alongs click here to get ride along to the next video because it's a well you see how it's it's a pun you see right along get it right just move right along
