most polarizing players in the week today is one of history's greatest offensive talent but he does have some glaring weaknesses we're not talking about it's a defensive game he doesn't show up when it counts he gets tunnel vision doesn't know what to stop shooting and can be very indecisive at times but the biggest weakness that affects his game has been strip clubs yes you heard me right I said strip clubs and this has been mathematically proven it's no secret James Harden has a certain love for the arts of erotic dancing let's say his jersey a couple years ago was retired at a Houston strip club because of how often he visited and how much he spent his love for these clubs are run deep in an elimination game in the Western Conference semifinal it was reported you will see that one of these clubs till 4:00 a.m. and to no surprise he had a terrible game shooting two for 11 from the field and 80 is team to a 40 point blowout the question became these strip clubs affect the level at which James Harden performs a redditor by the name of Ryan Sullivan set out to answer this question after hard at another horrendous game against the Miami Heat a city renowned for its world-class strip clubs my guy ride analyzed James Harden performance in every NBA City for the past four seasons and correlated it with those city's reputation for strip clubs to see if there's any relationship he did this by using D six stats and defining variables he defines subpar performances as Gabe's Harden performed below his season average and very subpar games as games 20% worse than his season average then he determined that average strip club rating by averaging the Google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs that popped up in his searches in each city now this is where it kind of gets hard for people who haven't take statistics right performed a regression analysis with the strip club data and James artist performances he found the correlation coefficient which is a measure of strength between two variables to be 0.45 75 which is a positive moderate relationship meaning briny found out to a statistical degree hardest performances declined in cities with higher rated strip clubs this was further supported when it was found party places best at Toronto the city with the worst strip clubs and places worst at Miami the city with the best strip clubs the takeaway from this analysis is to slow one of the greatest offensive talents we have ever seen isn't taking on Orthodox approach not hug his left side but invest in your strip club thanks for watching guys be sure to
