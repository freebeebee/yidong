pop up there go and watch that video i explain how the glazer strategy at manchester united now is based around a top four finish and not winning trophies anymore and that has changed since the glazers came in and in this video i want to go a step further and prove to you how the glazers are thieves at manchester united and have been thieves since they bought the club on a leveraged buyout deal back in 2005 using excellent research conducted by swiss ramble even in buying the club the glazers were leeches and i want to show you exactly why with all the numbers in this video so please make sure you like the video please make sure you share it because glaze is out will these videos make any sort of difference i don't know but i'm not just going to sit by and ignore as it happens so i want to talk about it in this video with you and show you with numbers and evidence the true scale of the thievery at united that has happened under the glazers ownership since 2005. i said in my last video that success at united in the last 15 years has not been because of the glazes it's been in spite of the glazes and how fergie i feel overachieved in comparison to the investment that he received alongside our rivals and in this video i'm going to focus on the evidence that's provided with the numbers by swiss ramble make sure you follow the link in the description to their football blog that they cover football in business and the numbers behind it it's superb it really really is so thank you very much to swiss ramble for doing this research and for united fans it won't be an enjoyable video but it's a video that we all need to watch understand share around to really truly understand the scale of the thieves that's happened at united since 2005. so as i said this video is using the analysis by swiss ramble that covers the last five years from 2014-15 to 2018-19 and what happened with all 20 premier league clubs so let's take a look at all 20 at once to start with and look at the financing here in the last five years up to 2018-19 chelsea had 433 million investment man city 133 million liverpool 57 million united 169 million left the club where other owners are investing in their clubs united the glazers are taken out of it they are and have been and will continue to use the club as a cash cow and i don't want to hear any about oh look how much united have spent on signings because as this shows the money is still going outward so the money on signings is relative to the amount of money that the glazers are taking out of the club but i tell you who has been invested in the glazers pockets just look at this and try and find united on this list yep we're right at the bottom whereas chelsea have invested united have paid nearly 90 millions directly to the glazers through dividends we are the only club to pay dividends to their owners that west brom number there is a bit of an anomaly that's not in on the accounts yet but united have paid more to the glazers than we paid for harry maguire than we paid for paul pogba and you're telling me that they're not thieves maybe they're not thieves on paper but we all know what they're using united for and it's not to get us back to winning the premier league again and it's not just with the dividends that money is leaving united at a rapid rate have a look at this in terms of the external financing united as a net loss 80 million pounds left the club still in 2020 15 years after the glazers bought united on a leveraged buyout deal because they did not have the money to buy the club up front we are still suffering the consequences of that and if you look at the numbers it gets worse because it's not 80 million that's gone out on interest repayments it's actually 120 million pounds and the only reason arsenal have got that 61 million is because they've got a stadium to pay for and so have spurs whereas united we're not paying for stadiums we're paying for the fact that the glazers bought our club on a loan because they could not afford to buy us in the first place as a payment structure for buying a club which is now not possible to do because it's it's not immoral i mean it is immoral but it's they simply could not afford to buy united so they used their assets in america as leverage as that collateral in case they couldn't pay now the banks are laughing about this they've made hundreds and hundreds of millions from united in terms of interest repayments the glazers are laughing over 111 million in the last five six years alone in dividends then you look at the value of united that's gone up they're going to make hundreds of millions when they eventually do sell united and the only losers here are manchester united as a football club and the fans because we're not a football club anymore we are a business first we are a cash cow for the glazes a hobby a side project a guaranteed 20 million per year in dividends happy days we are not a football club first and foremost and we've lost that because of the glazes and their ownership structure of united just look at man city at the same time 133 million has been put into the club look at liverpool 57 million has been put into the club then look at united and the numbers at this point are truly staggering in the last five years we paid 209 million pounds for the glaciers ownership structure 120 million plus 89 in dividends and in fact in the last 10 years we've spent 838 million pounds on financing 488 million on interest 251 on debt repayments and 99 million on dividends and we took out a 140 million loan since the year end the glazers their ownership of united and what they've done to united since 2005. thirdly success that he had with that incredible team between 2006 and 2009 arguably the best premier league team we've had that was not because of the glazers that was in spite of the glazes somehow fergie managed to do that and managed to rebuild a title winning team in comparison to our rivals we've had under investment since 2005. and this summer we sat there with donny van der baker now we haven't signed sergio regal because we wouldn't pay up front a big enough fee to get rid of that buyback clause and instead we're going into the new season with one new signing that's not the priority signing and only going to socialize a manager has not been backed by his club the one thing that fergie called for when he left as manager and the scale of the thievery look at those numbers again nearly half a billion in interest repayments alone nearly a billion is left in a lot it just pisses me off that there are people that will sit there and say oh you signed harry maguire oh you've signed aaron masaka what are you complaining about they really truly do not understand the scale and the structure of the thievery at united under the glazes because when you look at these numbers like this it's insignificant spending 50 million on wambasaka it's insignificant spending 80 million on harry maguire in comparison to the significant thievery i would call it at united has happened under the glazes the constant dividends the interest repayments the whole leverage buyout was a complete and utter fast and there's nothing else i can really say about it there's nothing i don't think that we can do about it but it is important that we do not ignore it as a set of fans do whatever we can whether that's getting a hashtag out training glazers out woodward out was trending i think this week do what we can and all i can do is do videos like this that present the evidence that show people that help everybody understand the true scale of why the glazers are such horrendous owners at manchester united how their top four model is now united's new strategy and how much they've taken out of the club and how any amount of signings can't hide that fact other clubs have invested around us in the same time frame chelsea city and liverpool and they can continue to progress as clubs but until the glazers leave united we've got shackles on and we're not a football club anymore we're a business first that so happens to have a football team playing on the pitch at old trafford what is the cost of lies is what aditya reds asks in his latest glazers video and the cost there is quite apparent 488 million on interest repayments nearly a billion going out of the club 20 million plus in dividends per year the glazes man that's all i've got to say please share this video please like it please continue to spread the word it's all we can do but you can't just sit by and pretend that nothing is wrong at united when everything really at the core is rotten and still is you", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1656, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:05.360",
