that TV this is my match reaction from Wales for Ireland Warren what an absolute shambolic display of football from an Irish perspective I mean two girls in the first 20 minutes it was an absolute show and you know I can't start the game so badly you're looking at it um Tom Aaron's a skull he took it very well thank our bails go I mean you're looking at it and you're looking at you know everybody knows the girl is everything everybody knows what Gareth Bale's all about and you've given that time you give that space two corners left foot he's going to punish you it's it's you know common knowledge he's gonna punish you like and it's it's the usual shite work with it with us you know we're it's the same Ericsson in Dublin when he scored as well you know give him the time and let him shoot yeah and he's kind of polishes and that's exactly what happened and we're to nil Delmon in the first 17 minutes and we've nowhere to go I mean we don't score enough goals as it is anyway so the fact that we go to kneel down and you know the last four ideas we lost for identity once again it's the same old shite with Matt on here and Roy Keane and that's the sad harsh reality of it and until we get rid of them it's gonna be the same old crap and I understand there was injuries I understand that there was fallout in the camp but who's to blame and that you know it's the management falls to fix these teams if I have a father with my manager and work I talk to him I fix it I either leave or I get out it's one or the other and in football now's the time generally people get out you look at Johnson Walters he got on with it anyway that's a story for a different day but you and lineup just confused the absolute out of me you're looking at it said out there and who Rihan and so I was Christie on the wing makes no sense we were oughta shy from the word go I think Coleman guest of honor but in the first couple of seconds I make the balls of it and that's set the tone for the whole game we were just absolutely shite and obviously you know Ramsey gets the third goal and but we never look like ever getting a goal who carry on to the second half they get their fourth then we get a goal to Shawn Williams he took it well he capitalized on the defensive mistake from the Welsh but it's what I'm saying is you look at the Welch team you know first common left so Chris Coleman left um they get it they get invoice imagine what fresh ideas a manager with a whole new philosophy and you know brings in young players and Ethan a Purdue I'm Pam Purdue sorry and was absolutely I'm standing in the middle of hockey made our midfield look like a bunch of amateurs I Premier League players playing them so in Hendrick and then you look at who were in a way these patterns are not international level players which is we want to love them when they do well on the championship there are no international players we are looking at the likes of Connor and you cannot step up but the looks of things and you know that was not a great midfield they were up against today and they made them look like absolutely world obviously caravans were class but the wisdom and aunt they're just they're going on as if you know oh well poor little oral and them well the exact same the only difference is they have a workhorse pangarap LLC our only difference between us and Wales you look at that goalkeeper and they're back for maybe beside their Davis left back no really any of them are worth anything at all we've lost 4-1 to Wales you know and that's not taking any credit away from where else they were they're magnificent and the crowd kept on the whole game that's not to say that the Irish guy weren't behind the Argentine because they weren't remit the whole game you're a team how do you are in finance woke up behind the team put it's not gonna change in jeroni and in keen and until we we realise this I mean I did an interview with John Hanson the other day I think you were saying you know we've got to back the manager we've got to give him a new coach we didn't back him the Naoe back them we didn't back them and no one's made a big enough case about this only link II need to go and that's the harsh reality of it if you disagree you know let me know in the comments book as far as I'm concerned we need a new manager with new philosophies who's gonna pick in players who want to actually play from and not have people scared come to the camp because they want to fight with the the assistant manager it's an absolute Bismil display and I don't even know where to go it is like I'm looking at the polling game and to strugglin think how are you gonna you know we were looking at the very poor USA team very poor USA team and then we got stuffed by Turkey we got stuffed my friends and nothing's really changes to Denmark game and you know rambled on here and I'm really really not in the mood because this this is my first away game and this was supposed to be joyous occasion and you know credit to the FAA Wales they looked after me a noise seats everything was perfect but except for the result because we just were incompetent and everything else but that look that's been much reaction and let me know a you in favor of man or Neil to be still manager or would you least like this him go and someone like maybe Chris Hughton come here let me know in the comments because I would love to know and I would love to hear from you guys and and as always don't forget to subscribe and if you like this video drop a like tell us why you like this video and if you dislike this video drop dislike and tell me why he did not like this video thank you very much for national pop on TV on to the next", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1147,
