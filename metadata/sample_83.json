j 109 across the across the line tomorrow morning the lots for breakfast Simon porridge always pose your breakfast followed by a scotch egg and again instant breakfast so here is the course on this antediluvian piece of a GPS carefully happening and at the moment you can see we're going down saillant will pop out through the needles channel over to sand or burns deezer bboy back to rock the first virtual waypoint wrong one due south to rock to this looks like a beat this will definitely be a beat up two hours and then into Gill kicker darling boy to finish this back Eddie here ends at about age appoint then we'll all start taking about an hour tied on the nose so the race is going to be to see who can stay you know tight this deep snow for these asymmetrical go Simon Harper timido it's all doing such a bad job at least to communicate like you stop asking me to do this the winch man's a wonderful man he's keeping us but we sailed west diving down so through her steroids and headed on to the DCPD boy after dosing coast I'm just putting in a clearing waypoints a cable to the north east of our virtual waypoint just to give us a bit of margin for error hey that's my cord let's set for it sure finish the skirt please well it just sailed all the way down to westwood end of the course not d ZB so we have lights all the way down now we're beating back up 20 miles up to our first virtual mark pizzas for lunch today nice hot pizza cheese melting on it and I reckon in some of the other boats they'll be squeezing tubes of mountaineering food into each other's mouths for some flasks of by now luke warm soup but with some nothing but the best for my crew so the beat continued into a cold northeasterly wind tools the first virtual mark of course a brand new walk innovation I'm getting that brick oven sensation and I think that's what we really need with Jay 109 tireless your why we're here but it's quite fun really and we're just sailing to a kind of a gate here goddess atomic device everyone's been sheepish about this grounding there 200 attack now okay we're around that we on the basis that my clearing mark here was a cable from the wake one we had to go around we went round within half a cable buying that's pretty damn good I'm looking at this yacht in front of us just rounded up guys under that cloud I've always see it as a bit of an adventure it's just good fun getting out in the water and I like the Doran's aspect of it I like being in a ball that can run harder and quicker for longer than other books I think ultimate like sailing and now the crude take down the spinnaker and good time to prepare for rounding the second virtual map it's just now yeah it's naturally there with a virtual light on top it's a mermaid you can come you can start coming left now yep i'll start hardening up okay you're around you can come on bring you joy to supper I thought ization very nice nothing everyone else agreed but it was quite a surprise when we did the Dahlia so when a pass Tamika ride it was the sandia surprise it was a delightful end to an Italian yes when a nice spot of garlic bread is to top it all off we are out on 39 miles fees from the second virtual Waypoint hours aim to get there about hop us three with any luck in the morning and I was more proudly did you see at this party virtually sorry while i was on the sub-basin same challenges bring over the copper mark danger after a long bitterly cold light into the 20 not northeasterly the gray dawn finally came it was maybe it was pretty chilly having rounded the oilers light we turned on a northwest side effect towards the finish passing between the two forms the eastern end of the sermon are those arthrosis it was an exciting race it's a bit cold but I think in terms of the finish in our position we accomplished a lot of what we wanted to do we did meet other Jays which i think is important as a benchmark and we know that their 12th fruit well sail j so i thought
