on the ground so you can learn how to do the wooden dummy form properly because footwork is very important in this form so if you have the guide on the ground then you'll be able to follow along so let's begin [Music] so if you do have a wing chun dummy what you do is you start with the leg of the wing chun dummy if you don't have a wing chun dummy you can start anywhere just start on the point on the ground so the leg here ends up here so this is our starting point and from here we want to measure two feet two of your actual foot so one two and then you put another point here and then you just draw a line from there to the original point now you can do it going the other direction one two feet put a point here and draw a line going from there to there now from each now you have this line going straight down this way now at the corners you want to go 90 degrees and do two feet and then you do another point here and then connect that and you do the same thing over this side two feet and then two of your own feet not actually two like imperial feet two of your own feet length and just connect that together now you have this and now you connect this together and then in the middle you just connect the one in the middle here and then it's helpful to put some halfway markers here and later on in the form we're gonna actually use this part here which is another two feet so we can go like this and put a mark here and also do it on this side measure two feet one two and then draw a line there so even if you don't have a wooden dummy if you have this drawn on the ground or you you can use tape if you don't have chalk you don't want to right on the ground just use masking tape and make the same measurements on the ground and your starting point would be like this so just imagine there's a wooden dummy leg that ends up here you", "text_to_speech_word_count": 413, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:09.468", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " Welcome to David
