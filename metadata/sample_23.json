that's it full-time Mad City have won this game Mastery one Arsenal now Arsenal are now knocked out of the competition these they they could have won this game they could have won this game at least drawn this game that they ended up losing Man City are now in the FA Cup fifth round thanks to a case second half goal uh for now the master Pep Guardiola still has the edge over his his student Michaela Teta that the Arsenal boss will be encouraged for sure by the by by the performance of Arsenal I think they did really well they competed uh with Mad City first half the game was nailed nailed they were just canceling each other's out in the second half I thought Arsenal did okay as well uh just for one moment they just couldn't focus when um had the ball on the left hand side and they couldn't contain greenish on that left-hand side and arcade got a wide open shot on goal which was probably the difference of this match but all in all I think Arsenal have done really well as you can see the uh the stats for this match uh possession wise man City Arsenal 54 to 46 shots on gold eight to eight to five uh pass completed expected goal is pretty much the same I thought I thought it was an even game I thought it was an even game it could have went either ways that would not have been surprised if the game has actually finished uh nail nail or one one but in the end Man City won it and you looking at the lineup the starting eleven if you look at the starting 11 for for these two teams Arsenal have made six changes they have made six changes coming into this game versus Mad City who made two changes so City actually went with a very strong team for this game versus Arsenal it felt like they were just saying okay if we win this we win it but let's just not get beat type of thing that's I think that's the feeling I have from Mikhail arteta's lineup and they ended up losing the game but it's not a shame on them I think they showed that they're they're they are a quality team advancity is not the same team yes they've won we should be applauding them but mastery they still don't look the same to me the last last season of Man City should have created five six seven click a chance in every game now you don't see that now this fancy team is struggling uh to create uh that sort of chances in in every game and the tempo also has dropped from last season there's something wrong with them and Pep Guardiola rightly Soul came out and had a blast in the team at the team uh last week so look in the end uh a win is a win a Man City all they care about is the win and they got their win and Arsenal are out of the competition which means Arsenal now they could just focus on winning the Premier League uh Five Points clear at the at the top at this moment in time um they do have one competition left which is a Europa League they might they might compete in that or they might take it lightly but Arsenal fans I think they should not be uh bothered that much the fact that they are out of this competition um but anyways let me know in the comment section who was your matter to match I would probably just give it to RK because it was the difference in this game but I thought like I said both teams did just canceled out each other uh but do let me know in the comments section who was your man of the match and and yeah thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video don't forget to smash a like subscribe to the channel if you guys are new and I'm out peace", "text_to_speech_word_count": 697, "timecoded_text_to_speech":
