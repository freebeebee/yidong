mound he doesn't think he's seen somebody attacked ramirez the way that you did do you do you feel like that out there i feel like you have to have that confidence on the mound um if you don't a lot of hitters can sense the lack of confidence but that's nice of him and he's a good buddy of mine so thanks for hyping me up what's the feeling like when you're in the zone like you were tonight striking out eight guys in a very good lineup it was actually weird i felt terrible in my pre-game bullpen um i was talking to barney the bullpen catcher and it was literally terrible could not throw a strike and then i go out there and it was 3-0 and i was like oh here we go and then i don't know it just clicked and uh felt good after that so maybe i gotta have more bad bullpens more focused on throwing strikes i was talking to nestor about it too because he said that some of his best performances have been that because it almost locks you in and in my pre-game bullpen normally i'm just throwing getting my pictures in getting warm for the last 5-10 pictures of my pre-game bullpen i was like lock it in dude like let's go we're about to get in this game so um it totally could have but uh yeah i'm not going to intentionally do that anymore but yeah it felt pretty good to actually execute when i got out there michael what about this performance can you take with you moving forward um i mean just kind of build off the confidence build off of located my fastball pretty well i'm staying ahead of the count um this is one of those where i had both off speed pitches um commanded pretty well and um yeah so i just got to kind of build and stay confident there are not too many relievers who can command four pitches uh the bullpen does that play differently where you know i think later innings guys are probably focusing on one or two pitches most of the time yeah i uh um well thank you for that i uh i felt like i was i was able to command it today um and that obviously doesn't happen often um i actually had a text from sam breen our minor league fishing director and he said like you had all four working today um because i've always talked about if i have four hopefully plus pitches and only two of them are working out of the bullpen i can easily get through a lineup not easily but at least be confident getting through lineup and when i have all four it uh allows me to kind of do some fun stuff and then and toy around with players and really keep them off balance and so yeah it's been a weapon for me and i feel like that was the first time i had my change up um that i was able to locate um and then was able to really have sinker and four seam um that i could put kind of wherever i wanted and i was able to get ahead of counts that way michael if you're out there are you counting along with it do you realize you've got seven in a row i had no idea that i had seven in a row i knew i struck out the side in the second um and then when i went out there for the third i realized i struck out the side of the third but i wasn't paying attention that it was seven in a row i had no idea um but yeah i i mean i'll take my uh three innings and bounce",
