Alright, so I haven't posted him like a couple weeks I made a video and it was not well-received. So I just decided to take it off I don't know if that's like frowned upon but I'll really give a fuck but if you guys want to support me and then hit The like button hit the subscribe button Show me some love drop a comment share my video with your friends try and get me out there today We're looking at my subreddit to see which match I'm reviewing and it's from you slash and Gavin Okay, 145, New Jersey high school Okay in this video Gavin is the big strong kid in like the gray. Okay. He's posted a couple videos on my subreddit But this was like the most uploaded one. Okay, so right here The first thing you do is like you're an athlete and it's clear. You're an athlete it's clear You're big and strong and you're stronger than this kid and you were stronger than the kitty posted in your other video Which is good like it being strong is definitely an attribute that everyone wants to have but like you're not you're not Seeing like the windows that you're creating like you're opening your you're getting like two-thirds of the way there and you're not finishing it Right what you did? Usually you have to start from a Russian, okay Usually you have to get someone someone has to post on you is to get them into a Russian They have to post on your head and you have to collect that arm and put it on the other side Okay, this kid was posting with both arms and you will be collected his arms and you had them to his side like his arms Are right here and he was trapped So this kid was like this right standing in front of you and you had his arms trapped With both your arms and you went for like a trip, which is not what you do Okay That is not like I don't know who taught you that or who showed you that? But what I've always learned from this position like when you had someone like I don't know it's like a bow tie in jujitsu When you got someone to make this bow tie? What I like to do is I like to tie it off right if their arms are right here I like to tie it off with this arm. Keep this tight really tight and then you wrap around their head You almost grab their headgear? But you try to grab their chin and you spin and they both flat on their back Like I'm telling you they fall like they go from standing to falling flat on the back It's almost like a head throw motion, but you have both their arms, you know what I mean until they can defend it They can't walk around your waist You're tight right here you spin and they fall flat on their back and it like knocks the wind out of them Let me tell you guys this sucks so much. I hit this and matches. It is a very good move I think I've shown it in Like other videos so check that out for the inside took to work You would have had to go knee to knee and like lean more to that side. You know what I mean? You'd have to make him put all of his weight over the leg that you're trying to trip But you were like letting his weight be supported by his other leg. So that's where you went wrong you could have had that but I know that seems like a really low percentage move because you're like you have to Posts right and you're trying to take him out with like one of the posts he's using you know what I mean? You're not trying to take him to one of the posts that he can't use that you already have trapped You're like you have two traps and you're trying to take out another post to take him down and I think you should just and when I say post I mean things that he can post out on and like Stop his face from hitting the mat, you know, stop his dick from hitting the mat your arms and legs are post Okay, so when you have two posts trapped, then you should take the person to those posts to the mat You know what? I mean so you could take them to the arm Not try to take him to a leg not try to make him fall to their head Does that make sense? I got I'm not sure that was clear if it wasn't I might make another video on it comment down below but continuing And go for the trip you pushed out of bounds All right your stance I want to know something your stance is not good You're just like you're an athlete so you can get away with it but when you go against another athlete that is disciplined when you go to state and you go against someone who is actually good who actually Practices in their stance who actually wrestles in a good stance who has a quick level change who has seen this shit before who has seen you trying to grab them and hold them and Muscle them you will get taken down and you will get worked it is going to be sad Okay, you need to have a good stance You need to be disciplined just because you're strong does not mean that you are exempt from the rules of technique You know what? I mean? Okay, you're in this tie up You're pushing off of him You know the other thing you don't know what to do you like all of your pushes are very like extreme and big movements See, like look ok. So right there Right here. This is tragic. This is a tragic tragic moment. All right Like this is why you need to focus on your technique, okay, you snapped him down That was a beautiful stop down right you brought him straight to his knees You had him on his knees and then you didn't do shit with it Okay You had you like took him down you put him in a black position of like you took him out of position You did this snap Which is hard Right jumping back following your knees that takes kids a long time to learn like you have to be athletic to do that Are you a stylist energy you do it you get into his knees and then you don't do anything you let him stand back up You don't pressure him you don't try to spin around you. Don't try to get ahead in arm You don't try to get an a bulldog or you know what? I mean, you don't try anything You just like let him stand back up Personally, I'm going for that snap. I know what I'm gonna go for after he gets to his knees I know I'm gonna bring him to his back from the snap You know what? I mean, but instead you let him get back up Okay you let him work you and think you let him have that time to think to get back up and start pressuring into you and then with that pressure you could have done so many things right you could have done like a Million flashy moves you could have done a souffle a lateral Like whatever you wanted with that pressure coming into you, but you decide to do a head throw Okay, the shitty thing about a head throw is if it's like even a little bit telegraphed right if it doesn't happen Perfectly, then you will get put like a good wrestle will get behind you You know what? I mean if it doesn't happen like in the midst of a scramble then you are gonna have you're gonna get scored on like how you were trying how you were twisting and you were holding on to his head if For de set if you twist and you feel his head right here, you feel yourself pulling a little bit let that go Just focus on staying on your feet. Okay? Because if your hands touch the mat then you scored is too you have to understand that when like when you're going for a head Throw if they're if their feet stay under them and they keep a good base Then they're gonna get behind you and this is exactly what happened. This was tragic This should not have happened. You could have gone for an over-and-under and hit a lateral you could have You could have reshot you could have there's a million things you could have done, but you want for the lazy thing Okay, I don't know what you're trying to do It looks like maybe you're trying to fat man role where you like Pinches elbow and you put his shoulder to the mat and then you like put your hips over I'm nothing ever done that I used to do that a lot. You know those younger. Okay, so you hit the switch All right, you stand back up and look dude You stand right back up you go from a switch to standing straight up I'm telling you some savage you're in the 145 pound weight class in New Jersey There are some fucking savages in there before you get to state Like I can promise you at Regent's there's gonna be some kid that is going to give you problems because of your stance Okay, you looking a good wrestler? You look like an athlete you looking you have potential but like if these minor details are going to screw you over and it's going to suck it's gonna make you miss out on The things you want to accomplish, you know what I mean? See look you're standing straight up and 145 you should not be standing up like this you're getting away with it because you're bullying this kid around Right. You don't really have good head position. His head's in your ear, right? You should be trying to put you like his head should never be in your ear You should be trying to put your head in his ear. Okay, and then that I don't even know how you did that, right? so you went from an underhook and you basically just jacked it up you like try to step out and You just like muscled him over that was just bad wrestling on that kids part Okay, that was like I mean, I don't know if you learned that I don't know if you've ever done that cuz like you don't have his arm trapped That's just bad wrestling on his part Like he should have been circling with his feet and like trying to get parallel with you Not just letting himself get Boyd over. This wouldn't work on a high quality wrestler You know, I mean if you focus on your technique you will be deadly you will be deadly if you focus on Learning something and getting it down and practicing it like it in the you could have ended the match in the first five seconds Okay, dude, you could have ended the match right away like with those two arms like like this. This is literally a money position having his arms in that bowtie is literally a fucking money position you want to be there that is Like how you end matches, you know what I mean? And you got there in the first five seconds You just need to know what you're gonna do with the position before you get it All right, so you can be quick about it. You gotta like makes you happen You can't just like sit there and think after you get the position same thing with a snap, dude You could have put into his back from that snap, but you didn't know what you were gonna do You weren't like being cerebral You weren't thinking it's good that you're a it's good that you're not late But don't let it be your only trait that makes you a good wrestler. Okay? All right be like Well-rounded, you know what? I mean?
