edition of SmackDown as well as the wildest new stories in roomors you need to know including is Triple H preparing us for the worst Triple H confirms WWE draft Brock Lesnar name dropped the rock pissed off with a fan at the hall of fame a new era are we going to get weather problems at WrestleMania and much more be sure to subscribe and hit that notification Bell for daily wrestling videos and follow us on Facebook for exclusive list also check out our new videos on WrestleMania XL as always won't recap the matches but just look at The Good The Bad and The downright ugly as always we start off with the good as number one beat down on the bloodline a Smackdown ended on a high note as baby faces Cody rhods Seth Rollins and Jay Uso got some payback on the bloodline after two weeks of taking a shellacking granted the baby faces didn't get their hands on the final boss so Roman Reigns nor should they because that moment needs to happen at WrestleMania but they got enough payback to enjoy some moments going into night one's big match number two Judgment Day run this place the Judgment day has been played by dissension and distractions over the last few weeks but last night's Beatdown on the new cat Republic was a great way to remind the WWE Universe just how dangerous Roose Rogue faction can be judging from the looks of things the WWE may have written off new cat Republic opening the door for another team to take its place at the six-pack challenge for the Undisputed Tag Team Championship number three Andrade turns on Lego del fantasma andrade's apparent alliance with Lego del fantasma didn't last long but then again was anyone besides Santos Escobar and Company astonished it's been obvious since his return that he has little use for Escobar and his crew Andrade lending a hand to Ray was exciting nonetheless even if it wasn't a surprise the real surprise will be Rey Mysterio discovers the person responsible for Dragon Le's injury and chances are he'll discover this during his match against Santos Escobar and Dominic Mysterio but do we think it's carito let us know in the comments down below number four Orton and KO turn the tables on Logan Paul baby faces are depicted as gullible against heel tricks but now with Randy ort and Kevin Owens both Superstars have been around the block including plenty of runs as heels where they did their opponent dirty enough that they weren't going to fall for Logan Paul's latest underhanded tactics showing the Viper and the priz fighter outsmarting Logan Paul was essential to keep both veterans from looking like saps after weeks of being outplayed by the Maverick number five good last minute hype for Wrestlemania while smackdown's WrestleMania buildup has been compared to Roars last night show was the right blend of buildup and entertaining matches angles and promos it was also good to see the WWE show some restraint with its hype videos providing plenty of real-time action instead of endless hype videos for Wrestlemania if ever the adage at show don't tell was aopo it was last night an LA Knight promo whether you think La Knight is a poor man's version of the rock or a strong character in his own right there's no getting around that he's entertaining last night's promo was typical La night but as fans know his typical is Light Years Beyond many Restless best that was a good what about the bad as Andre the Giant Battle Royale good idea but lousy in exec ution from day one is the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale an idea whose time is passed frankly the Battle Royale has never been anything special on paper the idea is great honoring the Superstar considered the King of the battle Royals with an annual match at WrestleMania or the day before while also giving WWE Superstars a chance to capture a moment of Glory regrettably the WWE has failed in its execution of the event not because of the match itself but because it's treated as a throwaway match where the winner is quickly forgotten and the career receives no benefit from the win don't believe us named two winners of the event besides Bronson Reed now there was nothing downright ugly a well-paced Smackdown that was fun W did fans appetite for Wrestlemania weekend all I can say is I'm hyped right now are you guys let us know in the comments down below now let's move on to the [Music] news now first story looks at Triple H preparing us for the worst is Triple H preparing WWE fans for a letdown when Cody loses to Roman Reigns some fans and Industry observers are pointing to some recent comments from the game as a sign that the Sunday's main event may not end on a happy note unless you're a fan of the tribal Chief consider these comments from Hunter during a chat with Pat McAfee people are going to nitpick everything it's just the way it is they're going to have their moments that they love they're going to have their moments that they didn't like whatever they're all going to analyze the booking and the finishes and everything that we do they're going to overanalyze all of it you said it earlier about Roman and rock people always go like oh we should have got that they should have done this it doesn't end a wrestling fans are no different than any other consumers of entertainment medium such as books TV shows and films Helmsley added that WWE is a Never Ending Story you know what happens at 11:00 p.m. on Sunday night when WrestleMania is over the second night of WrestleMania is over someone hands me the sheets for raw the next night and I start looking at that show because and we've already been looking at it but the story continues when you get to the end of the best chapter in the book that you've ever read you flip the page and there's a whole new chapter or there's a whole new volume there only mistakes if that's the end right but it's never the end it's never the end the story continues a wrestling has sometimes been compared to soap operas due to its serial storytelling but do you think Triple H is bracing fans for a Cody loss or is he just swerving us let us know in the comments down below next up WWE pl's on Netflix can Netflix add the WWE's PL to its content when the WWE's deal with peacock ends during an interview with Logan Paul Triple H mentioned whether Netflix which recently signed a 10-year deal to stream Raw beginning in 2025 would want more WWE content when it becomes available I think at the end of the day it would seem odd to me for them to say we want raw that's it we're good that doesn't seem to be how they're doing business I think at some point down the road when Smackdown comes up it's that something of interest to them down the road when the pl's come up on peacock that's probably something of interest to them it makes for interesting times and a really promising future if the WWE continues to crush it with television live events and ples count on its next right steel commanding top dollar do you think Netflix will land the rights to the WWE Network and pl let us know in the comments down below next up Triple H confirms WWE draft is the WWE still going to hold a superstar draft now that Vince McMahon is gone from the WWE during his appearance on Logan Paul's impulsive show Triple H revealed that the draft is coming and fans should expect it in a month or so Triple H says a new error is coming and whil we're on the topic of Triple H and on the Pat McAfee show He also mentioned that the next couple of days is the launching pad of this new era just getting started and they're just getting started at the beginning of it it's about to explode and you ain't seen nothing yet this place is about to be on fire what do you think this new era should be called should it be the Renaissance Era or should it be the Triple H era even Paul Heyman mentioned this in his induction speech last night at the hall of fame next up Brock Lesnar name dropped a Paul heyman's induction speech into the 2024 Hall of Fame class is garnering praise for its many memorable moments but like Paul Heyman it wouldn't be complete without a bit of controversy Heyman gave the WWE Universe something to talk about when he Nam dropped his former client Brock Lesnar two different times some fans were surprised when the WWE didn't include Lesnar in the Paul Heyman tribute video that a although that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's been following the Janelle Grant lawsuit against McMahon Lauren ntis and the WWE Heyman made sure to mention the Beast including this line they canceled me in ECW and who did I end up with the one in 21-1 Brock Lesnar Paul hman was an integral part of Brock's success in the WWE but hmon game considerable clout by being paired with such a generational Talent if you haven't checked out the speech go and check it out now it's truly amazing next up The Rock was pissed off with a fan at the hall of fame a recent interaction between the rock and a fan is making the rounds as The Rock was exiting the ring after he gave an induction speech honoring 2024 Hall of Fame class member Liam mayia The Rock walked up to a fan at ringside leaning to an exchange where the fan appears to say Cody's coming for you only for the rock to reply no what' you say before that watch your F in mouth some fans are speculating the fan also said something that such as your story's over or something downright disrespectful such as talking about The Rock's grandmother however some fans think this is the rock playing his final boss character and that the so-call fan may have been a plant next up Hall of Fame format fizzling does the WWE need to change his format for the Hall of Fame ceremony well consider this report from wrestle votes who mentioned Wells Fargo Center staff is actively encouraging the remaining fans here at the hall of fame to move their seats in order to fill up the TV side while the Paul Heyman speech was spect spacular this iteration of the Hall of Fame needs to be reconsidered the post SmackDown start time just doesn't work the logistics to the Hall of Fame have been a problem for years as the WWE has tried to balance how long it runs when it runs and who should attend it do you think it should just go back to its old format no fans let us know in the comments down below next up Roman Reigns surprise comments at the hall of fame was Roman Reigns work in the fans during his speech honoring Paul heyman's induction into the Hall of Fame the remarks from the tribal Chief already has fans talking is saying the moment I'm not with a wise man is the moment you won't see the tribal Chief anymore there's plenty of speculation about the finished Roman Reigns versus Cody rhods including Paul Heyman betraying Roman for the rock if this happens it could lead to a sabbatical for Roman who's already rumored to be taking time after Mania although a retirement is unlikely next up weather problems for Wrestlemania looks like it's going to be a cold night for fans attending WrestleMania at Lincoln Financial Field fan side mentioned a recent weather forecast for Saturday and Sunday per ACU weather the temperature for Wrestlemania 40 on Saturday night is expected to be a low of 38\u00b0 with mph winds as for Sunday night it'll be a low of 37\u00b0 with 6 mph winds PW insiders reporting that the WWE has already set up a heated ring much as it did when WrestleMania 35 was held at the MetLife Stadium and finally is Logan Paul getting an extra special entrance last but not least is Logan Paul getting a special entrance for his United States Championship defense that story is coming from PW Insider which notes it's believ Paul's entrance will have a time with his Prime energy drink which is a WWE sponsor and rumor has it some sort of Prime truck may be used but they have it folks I look at Smackdown as well as the wildest news stories and roomies you need to know be
