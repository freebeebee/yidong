of the Juno one the rocket that launched America's first satellite Explorer one the main engine for the Juno one was a rocket D A7 in a stretched Redstone stage similar to the one that would eventually launch Alan Shepard America's first astronaut on his suborbital flight the A7 produced 416 kons of thrust for 2 minutes and 35 seconds with a sea level specific impulse of 235 seconds unlike Alan Shepard's rocket it used Hine which is a mix of udmh on symmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and deta diyl andat triamine and liquid oxygen for oxidizer the original redstone engine used 75% ethyl alcohol and Hine was invented by Mary Sherman Morgan to give better performance however she wanted to name the new fuel Bagel so that the propellant combination would be bagel and locks the A7 and alen shepperd's Rocket went back to ethyl alcohol to avoid the toxicity of Hine the Redstone and A7 were designed by berer Von Bron and were direct descendants from his V2 Rockets which used the A4 engine which had the 75% of alcohol fuel Redstone Rockets using Hine are considered part of the Jupiter C family after Redstone stage completes its burn the instrument unit with RCS units in the cone on top of the stage aims the three remaining stages a cluster of 11 Sergeant solid rocket Motors and a cluster of three of them and then a final single Sergeant rocket motor and spin stabilizes them ahead of arrival at apoapsis the three stages of srbs each last for 6 seconds so they help the tiny Explorer one payload make orbit right at appals each Sergeant has a specific impulse of 235 seconds in vacuum and produces 6.7 kons so the 11 Sergeant stage will provide 73.7 kons the three Sergeant stage gives 20.1 kons and the final stage just provides the 6 .7 k each Sergeant has a mass of about 27 kg the payload to orbit of the Juno 1 is 11 kg it had three successes and three failures the first launch Explorer 1 was successful on Explorer 2 the final stage didn't ignite Explorer 3 made orbit Explorer 4 made orbit Explorer 5 failed because of the first stage collab with the upper stages on the final launch with project Echo inflatable satellite the second stage separated early leading to a failed launch there Explorer one of course was the spacecraft to detect the Van Allen radiation belt and on that note thank you for watching this rocket profile as you know why",
