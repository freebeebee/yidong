because that's my boy that's who I grew up watching following and cheering for but I also loved the sport in general and everybody around it and so I was an Earnhardt fan a Jarrett fan a Labonte fan a Gordon fan Wallace fan I mean I just I just love the sport in general so it was always cool to be able to watch these guys the different personalities how they went about being able to win their races how successful they were and just what came about and being a mass car fan yeah I'm definitely an Earnhardt fan I mean I think Gordon give Ernie hard to run for his money and obviously earned a bunch of it but I was always enter in our family I loved watching that rivalry I grew up a Gordon fan my brother drove and Earnhardt fans so we'd sit on the couch and harass each other during all those times it was it's a great time to be a fan of racing you know if I had to favor all the rivalry I would probably say Gordon simply because my dad was an iron heart guy and so I was always you know I was a Bill Elliott fan so I you know him and Bill Elliott had their their moments where they butted heads and so anybody that was against Earnhardt I was for that guy yeah yeah definitely you don't think I'm on the Gordon's side know growing up obviously being a huge Dale Earnhardt fan my whole family was and our weekends we're based off of where Dell Earnhardt was and hoping that in that time they antagonist Jeff Gordon wasn't gonna win the race and he was a rival at the time but you know it is so cool is I got to make a start in Jeff Gordon's final start and I really appreciated that moment meant a lot to me because I look up to him so much and he's an awesome guy he's done so much for our sport and guys like myself and to be a little bit a part of his history meant a lot to me he's a hero and a legend behind and my wife is was his biggest fan growing up so I think now I have such an appreciation for for Jeff and that whole series is gonna be a lot of fun I'm caught in between because my family we grew up rooting for the black 3 car but then this guy named Jeff Gordon came along and him and I share the same birthday of course Jeff's older but it was great to have August 4th as a birthday to share and his first race was one of the first times I was starting out racing as well and so I always had my Rainbow Warrior shirt on but it was underneath my Dale senior jacket no I mean I people were gonna take this the wrong way but I mean Jeff's a friend of mine now because I've got to know him but I wasn't a fan of either one of them just from the standpoint of you know my dad was also in that mix and and yeah I didn't I didn't cool free the one of them respect them but I was never never really a fan by any means so that's I hope people don't say the wrong way but if you kind of look at it from my view by I had I had family ties so yeah family first man to be on that's it's hard not to be on Jeff's side just because he's such a good friend and and I wasn't fortunate enough to ever meet Earnhardt senior there was one time I was actually down here for the 24 hour race I believe junior and senior were running it at the same time that year and I walked by him and they were talking and I almost introduced myself and and didn't quite do it but the amount of respect and and what you've learned about what aren't hearts done over the years you know there's just a level of respect with that guy that just flows through the whole NASCAR garage and and it's hard not to you know want to be on his side as well but I think just the fact that you know Jeff and I were such good friends over the years I'd be hard not to pick him you know for me that guy growing up was Dale Earnhardt you know being from Kannapolis North Carolina myself same places him it was incredible to see what a guy just a hard-working guy that's one of provide for his family was able to you know make for himself and you know build the things he built the lakes he built in our sport I was five years old and I started racing and he was the guy I wanted to be and for sure without a doubt is the reason that I want to pursue what where I am at today Jeff Gordon for sure I have I have to say that but also I'd like him yeah I never had a chance to watch you know Dale really race when I was younger so definitely beyond the Jeff side of it you know I've heard about all the stories and watch some of their rivalry going back and forth um you know I was one of the one of the random people that was kind of unbiased I mean I I watched through that arrow I loved watching every week loved the rivalry and I wasn't really on one side or the other I just loved the passion that the two of them about that well the bad thing is I'm a little bit too young to ever remembered Dylan hurt racing I was born in 96 so I was always a huge shift gordon fan so I guess you know I watched the few years between himself and Dale jr. when I was a bigger deal back then but I was always a big Jeff Gordon fan I'm fortunate enough that I've been doing this a long time that I've raced against senior and Jeff Gordon and I think it's knowing the quality of the people that did it I know who did it and I think it's going to be absolutely amazing I can't wait to watch it I do have it set on the DVR so I can see it and I'm excited to see how well it turned out do I have a side no I'm just a fan I don't have sides on it I like I like the whole aspect of it and you know senior vs. Jeff you know the old man versus you know the pretty boy and I mean it was I can't wait to see how they did my dirt racing background wants to take Jeff side but you know Dale Earnhardt was a man and everyone knew it and he he was you know everyone's used the Intimidator he literally intimidated everybody but I love their rivalry team I'm bored yeah I've been a Jeff Gordon fan and nobody else in my family was nobody none of our friends were so I've stayed strong with it and you know a couple years ago he actually recognized me in street clothes walking through walking between two garages I think at Indianapolis he just said hey Ross so that was I was really cool and a I was just trying to xfinity you know I just started so that was that was really neat for me that he recognized me I don't know I'm gonna see the documentary first but I'm gonna have to probably lead to its Jeff since he's my colleague oh so they have arts I'm going to get stim I'm from Kannapolis North Carolina so obviously I'm gonna be team Earnhardt but both those guys did amazing things with a sport and Jeff's a great dude [Music]", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1367, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:12.312", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " Oh man, I gotta go team Gordon because
