california sits a modest house with a grand history behind its garage in a small carriage house one of the seminal events in personal computing history took place the first modern operating system for the microcomputer was born here over 20 years ago it was called cpm and its inventor was a young computer science teacher named gary kildahl kildahl had started developing his control program for microcomputers also known as control program monitor in the early 1970s when he realized the potential for a general-purpose small computer he was carrying a portable computer at a time when the desktop pc was just a dream i met gary in 1973 in the computer science lab late one evening he was a young kid freckled reddish hair boyish enthusiasm was in cut offs came into the computer center with a leather briefcase that he flipped open and connected to a teletype an asr-33 and that was an entire self-contained computer it was the first personal computer i ever saw and i went wild i wanted to know where he got it how he got it what he was doing with it how i could get one gary studied computer science at the university of washington and went on to obtain a doctorate he soon moved to the naval postgraduate school in monterey where he later became a professor in the 1970s the seeds of cpm were planted during his teaching career at monterey he continued to work on the project at home and later in this tiny rooftop office above a restaurant in pacific grove the first thing i i heard that gary did that was really brought to my attention was he invented a programming language called plm and implemented it for the intel microprocessors to prove that that the 8088 was or the 8080 i'm sorry was a real computer and not a controller for for microwave ovens but that it was a real computer and he went off and and wrote a programming language that ran on microcomputers now we can say well well of course that's no big deal but at the time it was pretty big deal he invented this language and then to show that the language was useful he wrote cpm that's what really actually happened he created this operating system and and built it around this intel microprocessor to show what could be done with microprocessors and in 1975 when he was doing this that was pretty revolutionary gary's approach to computing was far ahead of the conventional notions of the time while a consultant at intel in the 70s he offered to sell them cpm but intel could see no use for it and turned him down shortly afterwards in 1976 gary and his wife dorothy founded a company called intergalactic digital research later shortened to digital research in an old victorian home in the early days digital research incorporated or dri was cpm while the operating system is just a dim memory in most pc users minds today its role in the development of the microcomputer was pivotal what's so important about the work that gary did was the fact that he was one of the first to introduce uh an operating system for personal computers that began laying the groundwork that basically all other personal computer operating systems hardware design and applications can take their roots from the main thing that cpm brought that was different from how anybody else was approaching micro computers was that gary made a logical separation of the physical i o system from what was called the bdos the physical i o system was called the bios the basic i o system and that was a term that gary used in early cpm the bdos was a basic disk operating system the bdos was independent of the specific hardware that you had in your microcomputer by comparison we were looking at the time of of unix being out as a major mini computer operating system and you could not move executables of any application programs from one unix machine unless it was an identical machine to another system so this was really a remarkable innovation cpm sold extremely well and dri flourished the company expanded to larger quarters across the street the number of employees grew from nine to twenty four when a new vax mini computer arrived it was too large to fit inside the building so the entire structure was lifted off its foundation to accommodate the machine a beaming gary told the staff they would all be getting a raise that week it was a time of skyrocketing growth by august of 1982 the company newsletter reported that dri's revenues had grown over one thousand percent in the past two years dri now had 200 employees cpm was established as the industry standard and the most popular 8-bit operating system in the world when the computer industry was just starting up there was there was the computer industry there was ibm and the seven dwarves and and the the the mainframe industry dominated by by glass houses and and and and giant mainframe computers cost millions and millions of dollars and and the the personal computer industry did not descend genealogically from that uh gene pool it sprung up in a completely separate way in a completely separate place and gary was its spiritual leader he his company was the biggest and most successful of all the companies and all of the companies were modeled after gary's gary was a very busy guy he was chairman of a large company he was personally involved in new product development yet every two weeks he would spend four hours driving up and down this pacific coast highway to spend a day in front of the cameras when we come back gary's new role as a television host with dri's business growing gary went on to other pursuits including the role of co-host on computer chronicles his second career as television host lasted over six years during which he provided acute insights into the technology and potential of hundreds of products while appearing on the program he also showed off products and technologies of his own that were far ahead of the market including a multi-tasking operating system for pcs called concurrent docs what's even more interesting is that all is not quite as it appears because in fact if you uh press a little key here you actually see that there are lots and lots of processors actually running lots of tasks running here and in fact on these serial terminals even themselves i can hit a key on this one for example and find that i'm running dbase 3 at the same time so what we're seeing here is the ability of the ibm ps2 model 80 as a 386 based machine in conjunction with concurrent dash 386 its ability to run both standard dos applications because the operating system is completely das compatible but to be able to run multiple dos applications and to allow shared access to them dri also had one of the first graphical user interfaces called jam i'll open up a pre-prepared graph and we'll see what the combination of text and graphics look like i'm going to go to a full scale full screen here you can see here's the final result of putting it together text with graphics and i'll just go ahead and send this to the output device in this case we're going to just use a screen but it could be a slide maker or or a transparency map or whatever it happens to be well i think that his interest was in um first of all showing that digital research was still the leader um and not um and that we had since graphical environments were sort of becoming hot if you will and you know the lisa hadn't really been successful but word on the street was you know macintosh is coming and and the fact that he could go and show a multi-tasking graphical oriented environment um running as a digital research project that no one knew at all that we were even working on i think he appreciated the kind of surprise factor of that and and he's i remember him coming back and saying that um you know bill gates and other people were at this conference that esther dyson had and they were like eyes are like glued to the screen trying to you know see what what that was going on so i think we put some fear in microsoft and i think gary liked that", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1461, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:04.471", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " On a residential block
