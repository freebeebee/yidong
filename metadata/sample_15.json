When asked what he thought was more difficult. He responds faster than a drill sergeant motivating his troops. &gt;&gt;It's no contest. NFL is a piece of cake compared to the Marine Corps. That was my response and it's true it is. &gt;&gt;In 1965, Dr. Burnham, still a senior in high school, was drafted by the Army which required a minimum of a 2 year enlistment. However, Dr. Burnham was compelled to join the Marine Corps and signed up to serve his country for 4 years instead of 2. He was sent to Parris Island for boot camp where the next 3 months would affect him for the rest of his life. &gt;&gt;The experiences were just absolutely dynamic and painful at times. The result of being committed to that was what I was able to do in transitioning from the military to civilian life. I have to credit that Marine Corps for really being the foundation. I hate to even think about what my life would have been if I hadn't join the Marine Corps. &gt;&gt;He would use the characteristics he learned as a service member, such as commitment and discipline, to excel in football and reach the highest professional level, the National Football League NFL. While competing for a roster spot, he relied on his military training to help him beat out the competition. &gt;&gt;My ability to compete and go up against guys who were considered superior had a lot to do with my experience as a Marine. A lot of those guys out there on the football field could not cut it in Parris Island and I knew it. &gt;&gt;Dr. Burnham is very involved with helping veterans who are pursuing their education at Wilmington University. &gt;&gt;Whenever I have the opportunity to engage with a veteran, I take it very seriously because I understand the price they paid, and I know why, I feel, even though I was one of the people who paid the price, I feel indebted to that veteran, because I know if it wasn't for all veterans, America probably wouldn't be the free country that it is.", "text_to_speech_word_count": 363, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:06.673", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " Dr. Lim Burnham, the Vietnam vet and former player in the NFL."}, {"end": "00:00:11.111", "start": "00:00:06.673", "text": " When asked which one he thought was more difficult, he responds faster than a drill sergeant"}, {"end": "00:00:12.513", "start": "00:00:11.111", "text": " motivating his troops."}, {"end": "00:00:13.514", "start": "00:00:12.513", "text": " It's no contest."}, {"end": "00:00:18.819", "start": "00:00:13.514", "text": " In the field's peace of mind compared to the Marine Corps."}, {"end": "00:00:21.955", "start": "00:00:18.819", "text": " That was my response, and it's true, it is."}, {"end": "00:00:28.529", "start": "00:00:21.955", "text": " In 1965, Dr. Burnham, still a senior in high school, was drafted by the Army which required"}, {"end": "00:00:30.631", "start": "00:00:28.529", "text": " a minimum of a two-year enlistment."}, {"end": "00:00:35.369", "start": "00:00:30.631", "text": " However, Dr. Burnham was compelled to join the Marine Corps and signed up to serve his"}, {"end": "00:00:37.871", "start": "00:00:35.369", "text": " country for four years instead of two."}, {"end": "00:00:41.575", "start": "00:00:37.871", "text": " He was sent to Paris Island for boot camp, where the next three months would affect him"}, {"end": "00:00:43.644", "start": "00:00:41.575", "text": " for the rest of his life."}, {"end": "00:00:51.652", "start": "00:00:43.644", "text": " The experiences were just absolutely dynamic and painful at times."}, {"end": "00:00:59.626", "start": "00:00:51.652", "text": " And the result of being committed to that was what I was able to do in transitioning"}, {"end": "00:01:02.930", "start": "00:00:59.626", "text": " from the military to civilian life."}, {"end": "00:01:09.169", "start": "00:01:02.930", "text": " So I have to credit the Marine Corps for really being the foundation."}, {"end": "00:01:16.343", "start": "00:01:09.169", "text": " I hate to even think about what my life would have been if I hadn't gone into the Marine"}, {"end": "00:01:17.344", "start": "00:01:16.343", "text": " Corps."}, {"end": "00:01:21.114", "start": "00:01:17.344", "text": " He would use the characteristics he learned as a service member, such as commitment and"}, {"end": "00:01:26.320", "start": "00:01:21.114", "text": " discipline, to excel in football and reach the highest professional level, the national"}, {"end": "00:01:27.854", "start": "00:01:26.320", "text": " football league."}, {"end": "00:01:32.759", "start": "00:01:27.854", "text": " While competing for a roster spot, he relied on his military training to help him beat"}, {"end": "00:01:34.127", "start": "00:01:32.759", "text": " out the competition."}, {"end": "00:01:38.465", "start": "00:01:34.127", "text": " I ability to compete and go up against guys who were considered superior."}, {"end": "00:01:40.934", "start": "00:01:38.465", "text": " Had a lot to do with my experience as a Marine."}, {"end": "00:01:45.305", "start": "00:01:40.934", "text": " A lot of those guys that are out there in the football field could not credit in Paris"}, {"end": "00:01:46.573", "start": "00:01:45.305", "text": " Island and I knew it."}, {"end": "00:01:50.877", "start": "00:01:46.573", "text": " Dr. Burnham is very involved with helping veterans who are pursuing their education at"}, {"end": "00:01:51.878", "start": "00:01:50.877", "text": " Wilmington University."}, {"end": "00:01:57.217", "start": "00:01:51.878", "text": " Whenever I have an opportunity to engage with the veteran, I take a very serious because"}, {"end": "00:02:02.356", "start": "00:01:57.217", "text": " I understand the price they paid and I know why they paid that price."}, {"end": "00:02:12.032", "start": "00:02:02.356", "text": " I feel indebted to that veteran because I know if it wasn't for all veterans that America"}, {"end": "00:02:14.234", "start": "00:02:12.032", "text": " probably wouldn't be the free country that it is."}], "youtube_age_limit": 0, "youtube_categories": ["News & Politics"], "youtube_channel": "Department of Defense", "youtube_channel_follower_count": 142000, "youtube_comment_count": 11, "youtube_description": "Lem Burnham enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1965 and served during the Vietnam War.
