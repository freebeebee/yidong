recently in the UK for a film tour and he helped set at bottle a simulation of the of like the crutch moves on that Connery Priya they recreate move for move it's really said it's pretty reactive that important have you had a look at their you company it's kind of I don't know I think it's like it's like I know that I can do it but maybe not first go but then just the thought of like trying it oh yeah it looks kind of weird though so I don't know I actually don't know show me the moves I mean I would have played a video as well already but yeah probably what do I get if I fashion prestige honor and slightly lower testicles thanks and also this also this turns into not great everything try not together without doing anything else today BOM dia my zoom gear mara-vee-oso Inessa there [Music] all right oh that was fine up into this and then I got like the thumb one and you've had no idea what maybe maybe you got together like that Berlin [Music] [Applause] it's a lot on that thought [Music] I don't know I hear ah that thumb is just there's so much tension on it here like it burns in here customers give it a pet curator yes so banging Joe loves carpet my Christmas present I go how do you know you're nuts roasted that's all the coffee that's coffee lingo right you love give me the beans and then toast in your being like this little buddy [Music] yeah it's pointed to this room all right okay beaver unlocked so I need my foot here to do the kick right you kick so it's not it's not like a full dynamic poufy deck yeah you keep one on and use it to buy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh how does it feel to send out this oh my god yeah pretty enjoy that it's like it's been so cool just to be like working out the sequence such a big beautiful climb I haven't seen it goes watch the ever seen it go see what are you doing it's just I mean every climber should see it yeah it's making my [Music] and you myself in the head space like you can't drop this yes it's such a good bowler I kind of want to like try and climb a ladder by the share be a bit tired and it's so different that go be so different it must have been so hard for him doing that after what how long you didn't use climbing for a while is pretty much halfway at war or even five yeah so that's like two hours and so this just a lot it's a lot of a lot of climbing he's done fulfilling like launching into there's like it'd be decent right yeah you know watching the film kind of maybe watch my some big old button yeah so I can't vote if you want to see us lose our shirts and big walls and turn it to patreon if you want to send us there the only person in the world to do the free solo free-rider yeah and you've got him setting that one of the hardest moves on it yeah it's pretty cool yeah it's like being over touch like one of Brad Pitt's apps can you'd be very yeah it's like something that legendary right yeah oh then it's just nice to get an insight into the climbing that's in the film yeah yeah yeah because definitely watching watching the film it's kind of like from a quantum perspective it's like yeah maybe I couldn't feel that is that maybe have done that from like 3,000 meters up I was even if I was I think even I was strapped into a harness I think I would still be like yeah I mean the the fear alone of just being on a rope for either us I think would us just be like weeping we now have a patreon account there's some cool rewards over there if you want to join kind of get more involved in this community go over there pledge whatever you can yeah it's just a really cool thing we also have a discord the link will be in the bottom if you don't know what this court is it's basically a chat room but there's a really cool chat on their people from the chat have like met and started climbing with each other so if you just want to meet some people too fine with walking on some advice on climbing or if you wanna chat balls the discourse really cool go and check out the discord thanks guys always see you on the big wall yeah [Music] all right now he going - okay people ten seconds of leaves you", "text_to_speech_word_count":
