that we'll be driving uh what what are they and what are they covering that uh we got kenworth freightliner peterbilt nothing over five years the age they're automatic and they're governed at 68. 68. okay can we take the truck home you can actually you would need to truck and trailer okay so what if i have a place to park the trailer can i disconnect and and uh bobtail home and parked the uh tractor in my driveway no we like we like it they couple truck and trailer couple okay okay uh what about driver facing cameras we do we have both ways all right uh now you was talking about the lanes earlier you know for flatbed and for the amphibian uh so is this just strictly like a regional or do you guys do r48 or or what mr regional flatbed you'll see like indiana illinois pennsylvania ohio mainly and you'll see a lot of ohio pennsylvania and tennessee okay would as far as uh as far as flatbed goes what what do what what what would we be hauling usually coils oh okay okay okay do you guys do you guys run any northeast and if you do do you guys pay extra for it uh not really i mean we don't do any new york city anything like that i mean i think they do have some loads that are like oswego new york and uh they got one load goes over to connecticut but yeah those floats generally carry a higher a higher value the line hall is larger so we pay percentage so you start 27 of the load and once you get a full month in you can go as high as 30 but yeah the line halls on those are usually larger all right now is that is that a percentage across the board uh for van and and uh flatbed yes yep same thing for both okay and what was and what was the average you say that we we can come home a week uh so gross you're looking between 1450 to 1700 a week for vans flat you're looking at about 17 to 2. all right now you now for those averages we doing like maybe like what three four loads a week at least yeah generally yeah i'll tell you i'm four to five okay you guys uh what about what what about orientation how how would you uh this this is a three part so how would you guys get me there how uh say what enterprise rental car oh okay well what yeah i have issues with enterprise um let me ask you this if i was to rent my own car would you guys reimburse me we would yeah we'd reimburse you the cost of uh of uh what we'd pay for the rentals yeah we reimbursed our call all right i i don't think i asked but where would the orientation be knoxville tennessee okay okay okay uh what about uh what about uh pre-employment drug testing is it hair follicles and urine or both urine okay and the hotel stay solo yeah okay okay that's what's up uh is there a sign-on bonus uh there is it's five thousand dollars first 500 of which will come on your first check uh it pays out within a full year so let me get pulled up here we've changed it for the fourth quarter although you say it's paid out a full year yeah over a year i'll take exactly that's paid out hey you said it's five and it's five grand it sure is you get five hundred dollars on your first check you get a thousand at 90 days 1500 at six months and then two granted a year oh okay okay that's what's up man that's what's up uh you know i got a i got a i got a driver buddy uh that drives for you guys i think he drive for you guys currently um i also talked to a couple of guys that you know that that previously drove for you guys because you know i'm in the facebook group and you know i mentioned i mentioned the company you know there's you know some drivers has varied opinions about you know the companies that they drove for previously um so if you know for bringing me on and for the drivers that's already there what do you do to retain your drivers well i mean we treat drivers right and they get paid well and they get home when they want generally i mean that's you get those three things right the rest of it takes care of itself so i mean especially home time pay you get those right i mean the rest of it just falls into place and that starts to bring on the right person and make sure we meet their goals up front um you know what i mean just like these conversations you know if you're not you're not okay with the home time and the pay you know that we we quote you then you know what i mean we we always we don't try to just get guys into orientation so you know i'll be the first one to tell you we might not be the right fit for you so um you know we we get guys that want to be on weekly and you know uh want to make that set amount of money and you know you get those two things right generally everything else falls in place so and we do a pretty good job of meeting expectations okay that's what's up man thank you very much for that uh can you guys can you guys help drivers get their cdls for the ones that don't have it we can't unfortunately i usually recommend people uh to a couple different companies but now we do require um at least six months of tractor trailer and i'll tell you we just started our six month program sits a little bit tighter um some drivers will fall into needing a full 12 months so you know work history and whatnot all right all right and uh sorry for rewinding back but the percentage pay is that is that base for everybody uh experience coming into the coming into you guys or you know like a driver like myself i guess this month i mean six years uh do i get uh do i get paid more percentage you don't um you start at 27 and we try to pay guys for production you know what i mean um you come in you work hard and most guys usually end up getting up to 30 percent um you know at least 29 30. so i mean that's where you that's where you boost your percentage so um i don't believe in a clean plate when you come here so you know what i mean all right all right well i appreciate the time man thank you very much hey man appreciate you thanks sir all right now thank you", "text_to_speech_word_count": 1856, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end":
