"resolution": "640x360", "text_to_speech": "I got laid off today as a senior iOS Developer so this is what it means for y'all and this is this is what it means for me my next steps my next steps are serving other Developers serving other developers and how I can serve other developers is by mentoring them how to learn better jobs how to learn better careers how to be strategic about it how to gain the right technical skill mentoring them on the right technical skill mentoring them how to how to put it all together basically how to put it all together because here's the thing when I started my tech career as a QA engineer this is one thing that I notice and back then economy was good the tech was doing really good and there were a lot of tech jobs and the really like if you know what you're doing it was not as difficult to land a job as a software engineer so it was really not that hard so we're like UA engineer for it for that instance but still like I I knew when I saw people struggle with that because people had trouble navigating careers people had trouble trouble navigating the right technical skills and uh and the whole when people had trouble navigating people and I was and I am very good at that so I Mentor other people how to navigate all that in um I was quite successful at it so and this is why I decide to like serve other um software developers by mentoring them coaching them lending them better careers better jobs so it's not just your like fluff about a resume and Link in and stuff like that so you can Google that stuff like I'm talking about navigating Tech Career making uh maximizing your earning potential maximizing your potential as a developer because I I want that path myself and I got really successful at it and I really would like to share my knowledge with other people another way I can serve people is by serving companies so if you are hiring uh an iOS Developer I'm a senior everyone's developer I'm I'm good at what I do and I work at Mid companies such as uh Nordstrom T-Mobile I was working as a QA at Alaska Airlines but I was touching quite a bit of a mobile stuff there too um I was working my recent company is a startup so I know how to work at startups as well so uh no matter what your need is if your big company is small company like I'm here to serve you as well I can help you with iOS development with scaling to iOS application I'm uh I'm very passionate about Swift UI so like I live in Swift UI uh in Swift UI land I'm also good with UI kit but we'll know uh you are a swift UI as what ample is pushing forward so I'm very passionate about that framework so I can help you with that if you especially if you need help with with you why but even if you're not working with UI not a big deal not a big deal because like I work with UI kit and and Swift UI as well so like this is another way I can serve people I can serve companies so and the way I like to serve companies though um not just like and this is one thing to develop software and of course I developed high quality software I developed high quality mobile applications that's that goes without saying that's that's that's the job okay that's the job but I also like to help teams and Mentor teams and Mentor other uh software developers how to be better developers how to get better communication leading by examples this is like this like this and you know if you ask my co-workers or former rather co-workers they they can tell you this is my core core values so and this is how I let at my recent job in my previous job leading by example leading by example this and this that's the value that I provide like companies as well so what you can do for me right now if you are an iOS Developer or if you are a software developer you don't have to be a mobile or anyos developer and you need guidance you want to increase your earning potential you want to figure out your career you like your tire of being where you're at you are tired of constant lateral movement nothing is moving forward and you will maybe you need mentorship on technical skills you can hit me up you can DM me my DMs are open you can connect with me and you can check out even my mini coaching session uh the link is in my bio so you can schedule free mini coaching session with me and see where it goes because my thing is serving other people if you are um if you represent a company and if your company needs services for as iOS Developer I'm here I'm here for you well I uh also like send me a DM send me connect request and I will consider that opportunity as well so now I want to go for it on on a little change in right like kind of like how we land here and like did I see that coming I saw that coming honestly because a lot of developers would say well with telling you like oh I didn't see that coming I didn't know that I was that would be me I did not know that it would happen to me um I so I I I've seen the trends I've seen the trends and I'm seeing that it might happen um and I'm not I'm not this is not it did not take me by surprise this morning so it did not take me by surprise at all so but why I decided to stay where I was because this year I was on the mission to help as many um developers as I possibly can to help them to get jobs to get better careers to my students their earning potential that that that was the reason that because like either like I'm focusing on looking for another job where I'm focusing on uh scaling my uh coaching business and mentorship and helping other people because like you've you've seen it right like on my LinkedIn you you saw me like posting content like literally uh five days a week and providing values with software developers and going live um uh every week really uh in providing values to other software developers so that this is why I was not like this is why I was not acting out of fear but I was acting out of courage to help as many developers as I possibly can and I thought like you know what if it happened it happens and uh when it happens I will figure out because there's a reason God gave me this calling and passion to help people especially in this Academy so and this is why I like I stuck to my calling I sat to my passion and now it happened I'm here to serve and I'm happy to serve software developers or companies or teams rather because like companies as a broad spectrum I'm happy to serve teams as a senior leader as a senior and it was developer and I'm happy also to serve either iOS developers in software developers as a mentor as a coach to get you to your mountains to get you to the next steps so thank you so much for watching uh please react share subscribe follow connect and comment so if you need somebody who needs my services my mentorship my guidance tag them if you are in need of iOS development like comment below send me a DM connect with me and we'll see in the next video bye", "text_to_speech_word_count":
