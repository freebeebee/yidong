"[Music] and we back as much Lombardi we're here with a cowboy video this is the time of year where I really get into the cowboy bag in terms of evaluating last season performances there's a lot of debates and transgressions online and this is where I kind of take film and break down the happenings and the discussion so expect a dak Prescott should get paid video at some point to really debate and drive that point home but today we're going to talk about Amari Cooper but before we get started I want to shout out my patreon people we're giving away a lot of free merch so just go ahead and sign up today we give it away to all tears I need to send dye line and stuff if he hit me with a dress and waiting on him I've sent the emails out to the winners for this month we're also gonna give tear isomers because he showed a lot of love in the in the livestream the other day and the handful of people that drop super chats to to help get the new sound board further for the set up or whatnot you know I'm gonna put y'all in a little situation you know draw y'all for some merchants well so we give away a lot of merch man so sub to the patreon man it's only $1 if that's what you want to do man I appreciate y'all but let's get into this Amari Cooper thing right I had to come up with the the criteria so to speak of what we call in a drop from Amari Cooper so I typed in back to Amari Cooper and complete passes right and I went through all their complete passes and of course some were bad throws by deck it wasn't crazy crazy the amount of them but some were bad throws we had some that were good coverage by the by the DB we're not gonna add those but I did have some that I had a tough time with right how do we judge passes that that kind of touch coupe in the hands but you know they weren't considered accurate passes take a look at this right coupe is up top and chat box this is a good time for me and you to have a discussion I'll be in the chat box for like 48 hours talking about this all right if you're Amari Cooper here and the past is kind of lowing you got a squat down together yes you're a professional and it kind of hits your hand so you should be rallying this catch in but I had a tough time with this I didn't know where to put it what I wanted my kind of rule for a drive to be was if the route was good we got separation the pass was on point hit the hands but we just didn't come down with it that's what I think I wanted my drop you know rules or criteria to be but chatbox what do y'all think about this about this pass here right it's kind of low coupe kind of got a cook he kind of got to go down to get it like what's the vibes on this I'm see if I can get a better view from car to view you know so it's behind them and it's low so tell me what y'all think about this let me get y'all two more examples of passes that I thought were kind of too tough to call there's these passes here where like deck really got a you know lead lead cooper going forward and all that so shall we count this right and cool kind of does a solid job corralling it he just didn't come down with it not yes that's an incomplete pass but by technical technical rules that's a drop for coupe do y'all consider that a truck I don't know I think if you got a dive and go on I'm sure you should have caught it right but in terms of we're talking about we're going to admonish you and and and wave our finger and fuss at you for dropping passes should this be considered us fussing at coupe in terms of dropping passes got another one to hold on we got the New England Patriots same deal right the past is kind of in front of them plus we in a damn hurricane right do are we adding are we adding weather implications here and and then cool barely drop this and it was just one of those instant replay a ball but it kind of touched the ground people are calling this a drop but what do y'all think chatbox let me know this these are the ones I had a hard time with now I have one two three four five drops that I thought were egregious five drops that I thought we're flat-out disrespectful five drops that we need to fix if we're gonna go to the promised land next year check them out we got a coop lined up in the slide up here let's take a look and see what happens here he's up top right here so this is what I mean by my criteria right he gets off the line well create separation boom pretty good right right there right and he is open and the ball gets to him and it hits them but it falls right now to pass ain't perfect here but every pass can't be perfect so let's just you know let's just consider all that right you would prefer coop did not have to stop and come down and try to pick it up or whatever but I do consider this is Drive because I do think it's catchable and of course the all this is quasi subjective or whatever but take a look at this um coops on the inside again right here and I think this is gonna go over his head but he's gonna yeah so so this is a drop for me this is flat-out egregious this ain't no conversation here this the six it ain't six but but the ball is is its place well the separation is good you get in front of your defender the ball hits your hands we just couldn't come down with it so that's driving number two a really much conversation to be had here but uh boy that was that was uh that's a big game and what's what's the down the distance on this reminds I know we talking about you know there's some cowboy haters that's calling back terrible and we shouldn't pay him and this was third down so this would have been a first down and you know you know how easy Dec woulda broke Toni record if all the drops that the Cowboys got weren't drops I think PFF PFF got us down for like forty eight drops or something like this forty three drops or what evidence that's ridiculous well moving on the YouTube Illuminati is taking money away from your favorite content creators and people often ask the best way to support the channel directly I tell them that subscribing on my patreon just one dollar a month with increased production and the frequency of uploads basically that means more content for you for less than a bag of almond M&amp;Ms you can support the channel called dibs on requests for future videos and you can have access to patreon exclusive material like my throwback film sessions that's patreon.com slash slash Lombardi I appreciate the support don't ski Wow ski salute what about this cool better top your screen here take a look at let's see what happens here separation but more bone come back hit him in the hands ball on the ground think that's that's that's pretty clear there would still love your opinion but I don't think we I don't think we're gonna get much debate out of that one let's just move on yeah but this one's uh this one's in Miami he's in a slide right here to the bottom a screen on the inside and he's gonna he's gonna hear these footsteps here as a focus drop there buddy that's absolutely a folk drop I think this is clear no debating here probably should have brought that one down that was ugly man that was ugly I see most of Cooper's real drops came from the beginning portion of the season and all of his drops that I kind of had debates with came from the end of the season I think that's that's kind of interesting here here we go once again coupang a slight down bottle following my mouse here going over the middle just off the hands right just off the hands um that kind of put a little mustard on this one and back to the hell it was fire coming off that much yeah you know but but you know I think don't don't should be should be caught let's take a look at cartel if you see it we get if we can get anything from the cartel view nope hit him in hand so yep that's it there now of course you guys can do your own research and come up with your own conclusions absolutely um but this this is my independent research this is what I got from I got I got Amari Cooper down for five egregious drops and the first four I showed you I kind of had a rough time with them the rest of the end completions that dag had to Amari Cooper we're like overthrows are just good defensive play so I'm not counting those but um hey if y'all disagree hey make a video of something okay I watch attack me to it anyway though man I'm Tasha Lombardi VOCA cello and be ard I don't forget by my patreon people giving away a lot of merch don't you miss out on that follow me on Twitter video CHL om b AR di y'all hold it down for the dose he was gonna piss
