company a dark side of him surfaced Ryback for years is now made disgusting comments regarding WWE and their management and he's even targeted Vince McMahon's late mother WWE cut ties with the former Intercontinental Champion completely and due to his bizarre and Disturbing Behavior that is still ongoing it's likely that Ryback will never be mentioned on WWE programming ever again the sunny is considered by many to be the first WWE D van during the mid90s sunny was a household name in WWE Sunny's problems with the law are well documented and in the year 2012 alone Sunny was arrested five times in a month in 2022 Sunny was involved in a fatal crash that killed a 75-year-old man it was determined that Sunny was intoxicated during the crash and in late 2023 Sunny was sentenced to 17 and A2 years in prison due to Sunny's inexcusable actions she will never be mentioned on WWE programming in a positive manner again during his numerous stints in WWE Alberta Del Rio was pushed as a top Main Event level star yet in 2016 the most Sinister side of Del Rio began to surface when he began to date fellow WWE star paig it would surface that Del Rio was putting Paige through physical and mental abuse Del Rio's conduct over the past 8 years has shattered his reputation within the pro wrestling industry WWE wants absolutely nothing to do with the former WWE Champion and recently in December 2023 Del Rio was seen wrestling in a high school gym at the start of 2024 Brock Lesar was identified by The Wall Street Journal as a former UFC fighter referenced an aince McMahon lawsuit that included sex trafficking and gross misconduct WWE were quick to act when it came to Lesnar as he was removed from all creative plans and this included a planned return at the 2024 Royal Rumble as well as subsequent PL matches against Dominic Mysterio and Gunther respectively WWE have since distanced themselves from the multi-time world champion and he hasn't been mentioned on WWE programming since the lawsuit surfaced Lesnar has been removed from all promotional material as well as various other digital projects depending on the outcome of the lawsuit it'll determine whether his ban will remain in place but as things stand Lesnar versus Cody rhods from 2023 SummerSlam event will have marked Lesnar's final appearance in WWE the allegations surrounding Vince McMahon have dominated pro wrestling over the past 2 years and they become so serious and so Sinister that McMahon is no longer an active part of WWE this was the right call from those involved as McMahon's conduct and lawsuits were bringing negative press towards WWE and TKO Holdings needed to cut ties with McMahon due to the nature of McMahon's alleged conduct WWE have since erased McMahon from history he is never mentioned on TV and if his face is seen on any type of content such as a video game then his face is blurred unfortunately new disgusting allegations directed towards the WWE chairman surface on a regular basis so it's highly unlikely that mcmah ever finds himself back in power in any capacity due to Chris beno's heinous actions in the summer of 2007 WWE sprung into action and decided the best course of action was to act like benoir never existed from the summer of 2007 onwards benoir has been mentioned directly on WWE programming and his accolades and matches are never discussed if a clip featuring Beno is presented to fans then their shots or images usually traditionally never feature him in any direct way beno's biggest achievement during his career was no doubt his win at WrestleMania 20 Main Event and although the match itself is a certified classic clips and references to the match have been non-existent instead WWE likes to promote either the Kane versus Undertaker and Eddie Guerrero versus Kurt Angle matches from WrestleMania 20 and over time those matches have interchangeably become the new main events of the show Even though some fans bizarrely try and push WWE to induct Beno into the Hall of Fame as they would like WWE to honor his wrestling ability there is ultimately no chance this would ever happen and Beno will remain as the wrestler erased from WWE's history books forever but they have it folks wrestlers who abandoned WWE forever be sure to leave your comments down below and I'll see you next time with some more wrestling content",
