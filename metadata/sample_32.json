scored what do you mean bazunu that's not his fault bro Jesus Christ every goal is the Keeper's fault you know that's not how it works [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell nice adoi take him on take him on adoi take him on nice run nice run adoi ah he lost his footing last second that's a dive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's on a yellow send this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off that is a dive re are you take this

but they should have had a red as well I mean the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Captain has a yellow card that should have been given against when he tackled Downs that was a clear yellow and then he's dived which is another clear clear yellow and they haven't given them they should have been down to 10 minut in the first half Brooks lovely lovely lovely Brooks oh no great defending that was excellent play B that's not cleared SOS save bazunu oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] god B thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you oh chance so much space for the lift back oh my God he scored yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off yeah back off uh it's a playoff oh playoff run started de Russell it's not Russell's fault man Jesus Christ we should have been up about three or four in the first half the captain should have been sent off in the first half Jesus Christ and then we go down to 10 men what can he do about 10 men he can't do anything about it oh my God I can't be if you're going to blame Russell Martin for this I can't bothered honestly honest to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God this has nothing to do with Russell Martin Jesus Christ we should have been two goals clear in the first half with the chance we had the captain should have been sent off in the first half should have been sent off in the second half as well we go down to 10 men there's nothing you can do who are you Isaac what are you going to do who are you going to bring on for bidra we don't have anyone we don't have another Center back and the way we've played has been excellent the system was um Steven steps into Midfield well if if if bck has to come off Stevens has to drop in who are you going to bring on do you trust Rothwell do you trust small bone well those two have been heavily criticized this season for being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] defensively so would you trust them probably not a change of system like bro yeah exactly I mean and the only thing I will blame Russell Martin for is he always if he takes off Chay Adams or takes off Mar whoever plays in that Central role he puts Adam Armstrong there who does absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nothing and gives us absolutely nothing because he cannot play Central Striker he cannot hold up the ball and at second half we needed someone up front and if you're going to sub off Adams which I personally wouldn't have done you got to bring on Mara that is the only blame that I have for Russell Martin is that we needed a physical presence through the center and Adam Armstrong can never do that he never does it he never has why change [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you guys oh my God are we seriously doing this bro okay so if your opinion is like that so did Stevens play bad today no he one of our bests okay did har play well today yeah did B play well today yeah where's your argument where's your argument don't change system we changed system and it worked where's your argument now like what are you talking about I disagree Crimson you do not want to be in Championship ask a Watford fan a QPR fan a uh who else West Brom fan H fan Norwich fan ask them if they wanted to stay in the championship in hindsight now that they're stuck here it is a ridiculous argument you do not want to be stuck here but it didn't work we lost Bradley oh my Christ when you lose game it's not always at the fault of the system you do realize that right you do realize that in the first half we absolutely tore them apart with that system absolutely Tor them apart what are you talking about it swi our aggressive side it was weird to put arm up top with a horrendous first touch like if you watch that second half back which you don't have to it's okay I'm not going to do it either a lot of the time we picked up similar positions that we did in the first half but the touches were wrong and doy beat his player so many times but his touch was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he couldn't take advantage of that Stuart Armstrong picked up positions couldn't take a touch CH Adams couldn't take a touch
