This channel gives advice o all of you guys who wants to be a flight attendant And I also put in videos about beauty and my daily life and travel vlogs as well So make sure that you subscribe to this channel if you are new to get videos like that You're interested only if you're interested ok so again and welcome to this Mini series that we're doing on this channel this series is all about your questions about being a flight attendant Can you still be a flight attendant? if you have this this this this okay, so this video is specifically dedicated to the Tooth* okay So the question is or the question we're going to answer today is can I still be a flight attendant if I have dentures Or (Pustiso) so so if you are interested in that just keep on watching so guys it has always been Conception or it has always been the idea that if you are a flight attendant. You need to have a good smile perfect set of teeth complete set of teeth and yeah, so what if what if only what if What if you don't have the perfect set of teeth and you have dentures? Okay That's the thing right um What I can say is that it really depends on the company of how strict. They are the dentures nowadays We can get different kinds of dentures. There is the one which is a fixed denture or the bridge Wherein we don't have to take it out and then there's the one that the Classic (Pustiso) or the classic Dentures wherein you have to take it out and it it comes off and yeah, there are also things like implants, okay So what I can tell you guys is this the job of a flight attendant is basically a service job which? Mainly is related to food serving food, so that is the reason why dentures or removable dentures are not allowed because there are instances or Just to prevent the instance wherein the denture will fall out to the food that you are serving This is also the reason why false lashes or the lashes that you put on your on your hair Lids are not allowed okay, because when they fall off. They will look like an insect Okay, they will look like a weird insect on someone's food So that is why our false lashes as well the one that you stick on. It's not allowed So if you need to put a denture on your tooth I would suggest that put a fixed bridge on it You have an implant or do something else that doesn't involve removing parts moving parts on your teeth well, that's just my personal opinion because Because of my background in the job as a flight attendant I've been applying to them for three years in the Philippines a local Company local airline here in the philippines and also have been a Flight Attendant Abroad as an international flight attendant for also three years and yeah that's what I learned about the industry, but when it comes to the application itself they don't really scrutinize if you have a denture or not, so It's really up to you. There are a lot of Instances that they will ask you to smile and they will ask you to say ah and they will really look inside and but Nowadays since there's a lot of people trying to apply for the Flight Attendant position They don't have the time to do all these things Okay, so basically if you look good when you are talking and smiling There's nothing that is obvious out there. You would you would be able to Wing it. That's all I can say and when it comes to medical here they look into your teeth report and every day and Department that is in charge of that is the grooming department if they find it that you need to really Put some fix bridge or whatsoever or this doesn't look good that Is their final say and they will tell that to you? after you are hired already make sure that you do everything to take care of your pearly whites and Also, they will take care of you Alright, so that's it for this question if you want to know other things that will help you get the job make sure that you Also check out my my my book It's called ready for takeoff eight proven steps to get your dream job as a flight attendant This is my cheat sheet when I was still trying To get the job as a flight attendant and everything I learned through eight years of trying to get the job.
