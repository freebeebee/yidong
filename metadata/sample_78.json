and that involves the hands you got the in between interlude hands you have to put together hands sometimes you have the knuckle hands if you have incorrect hands sometimes that can cause injury so let's learn how to make the correct hands now to make the correct hands you're going to make an l shape and you're going to bring your hands together you want your platform to be as straight as possible so you don't want to have these incorrect hands these knuckle hands these interloop hands you want to have l shaped so practice that a little bit i know that it might be different but try that out the last thing we want to do is cause the ball to ricochet off so make sure you keep your platform straight and your hands are correct now passing does have some shoulder action so let's engage those shoulders to make our platform completely straight no gaps as you can see my forearms are close as possible that way i don't have a gap so the ball can slip through or so the ball can ricochet off i'm keeping my platform as straight and flat as possible [Music] now to find your perfect stance you want to be a little bit more than shoulder width apart not too far where you feel like you're uncomfortable not too close where you can't get a proper squat but shoulder width apart the best thing to do is to practice to find the best stance for you so find that level of comfortability where you are comfortable you can move and you can engage now when finding our squat we're looking for something called middle position and that's the level of comfortability where you're not too low you're not too high you're literally in the middle so we really have to find where the middle is for you i'm pretty tall i'm five foot nine so the middle for me it's different for you so take time to practice that and then we're gonna review everything we've learned thus far now take the time to practice with me let's do all the steps together pause if you need to let's get it down now we're going to add on our last key which is the stagger we're going to keep our feet a little staggered apart not a full lunge just one step forward i used my right foot so i stepped forward just a little bit that way it promotes agility i can get the balls quicker and i'm on my toes now when you're passing angles you want to utilize your shoulders you're going to drop your shoulder slightly to get to a different angle and your platform is going to angle that way you also want to utilize the platform height so you're going to see me soon use my platform height to control the height of the ball how high how low the direction so your platform really does control a lot of aspects about the ball i suggest playing a little bit around with it so that way you can see the different directions you can go and the different things you can do passing a volleyball [Music] if you watch my volleyball vlogs one of the drills i do the most often it's called the left and right shuffle so a partner is going to toss the ball left and right five times on each side and short and deep that way it keeps me spry i have to move forward i'm working on my form and my shuffle try this at home don't forget when you're practicing to start calling the ball to get into the habit [Music] all right bye bye bye all right come on like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys next time [Music] you",
