blue i mean it's only gonna be a rehashing what i've said before this is i'm not even mad that the eagles didn't try for the giants the giant should have taken care of their own business i'm mad as the pathetic displayed by the eagles of not even going out there and competing in the fourth fourth quarter and end of the third that was factually disgusting and if you are an eagles fan you should be embarrassed to be an eagles fan because i've never ever ever watched a team intentionally take in my entire life adult life never watched a team through entirely tank and what for three picks in
