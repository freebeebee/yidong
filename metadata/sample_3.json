all are not too sure about young man he's actually disappointed with himself but we'll take another look with the same kind of work when he misses a hundred at delhi walked back very disappointed but this time i suspect it's for different reasons he thinks he's played it we'll get to know soon [Applause] now watch the back and now the ball [Applause] this will give you a better idea though in fact it's hit the back and the back was coming down in the struck with his air delivery of a new spell mohammed azeride has headed straight to the minute cover supply and mushroom made no mistake because wasim who took the catch of sukkoen's building in the previous over and suckling has done the job for his captain here the indian captain dismissed india have lost their seventh wicket that was not a great ball you can say it was not quick it was a little bit short outside of stamp and a casual shot from azerothin away from his body straight to the cows that ball was pretty away from his body and most probably it's two or five for seven so java girl srinath comes out in the middle he's the man who did the job with the ball yesterday but now it's his turn to deliver with the battle he's here because this is what happened a loose ball from akram and a loose shot from azerothin both the skippers straight to segments given scott down the leg side and good catch by moin sri not gone in further trouble for the indians you will see makram getting the results for pakistan he had early dismissed as this one was nasty for srina it was brilliantly taken by mohing khan off the glove steve buchner saying yes that he had nicked it barely reached the moin khan incontinent that's a good cat you have to just reach forward to take that one again earlier from a similar delivery from akron but at that time he was outside the line of the off stamp when the ball hit him let's take another look that was a very good shout out just one hey a little bit higher but it was within the stumps he spoke very well just moving away from the left-hander gangly playing away from the body hanging is bad at that one and was nicely taken by other mammoth look at those expressions that's going to be the important question [Applause] trump the movement and the angle just hanging his back at that one and was brilliantly held by mowing khan diving in front of the first lip plucked it in the air quite beautifully [Applause] even as you hit the ball angling that ball away look at that catch one-handed pickup wonderful stuff what a competitive figure my incarnation look at that the yorkers full two shot of good link deliveries to prasad that is how he normally bowls to the tail enders he's got a very very good yorker spot on most of the time so we'll be looking to get one there to hit the stumps and wrap this test match up as quickly as possible looking for a flashing cover drive was venkatesh prasad has a short back lift that was quite an adventurous shot most of the established players have not been able to hit akram like that prasad the front foot not to the pitch of the ball it's an airy fairy shot in the end [Applause] nothing's changed in the middle everything's changed outside the ground empty stands but the ball is still moving really can make that ball to talk rasheel macram so very crafty with the old ball [Music] same terrific performance six wickets down in the first half to fight back from there must be a great feeling uh definitely it's a great feeling and i would like to thank the whole pakistan team the way they fought back into the game everybody when we got out in 185 we had a meeting and everybody said they wanted to win this game so i believe they had a belief in themselves a lot of prayers back home in pakistan and i would like to thank people
