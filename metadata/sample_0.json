breathe Academy you go to bed thinking about what you learned that day you wake up thinking about what you're going to learn that in the next day it is yeah it's definitely very consuming but it's been amazing learning the ins and outs of policing the purpose of the course is to make sure that the people we've selected to join the organization are job ready by the time they leave and are sworn in a typical day for a recruit here at the Academy they would normally commence their morning where a morning parade and roll call then depending on what is scheduled for that particular day they could be doing some of their online learning products and assessment items they could be having some tutorial sessions with facilitators or they could be undertaking what we have called scenario-based training where they run through some practice scenarios in preparation for them being out on the road operationally it's a challenging course so the expectation upon them is to be committed to the learnings that are undertaken within the academy so the biggest challenge from a job that was that was hired all day every day to being in a classroom and doing lots and lots of study so it was a really big life adjustment for me but yeah after a couple of months it definitely started to feel like my new normal look the training is critical um it's it's critical for the organization to make sure that by the time someone has sworn in that they have the skill set to actually undertake the job but what it requires is not only an understanding of the laws and the legislative power that we have and are able to use in extreme circumstances but it's also an understanding of how they make decisions in a crisis environment at times and that requires a lot of not only the skills in terms of the learnings but it requires that the people that we select who have a value alignment with the organization being strong in Integrity having a sense of community a respect and fairness and professionalism that they apply those values in an operational environment at every time upon their successful completion and graduation the program they then enter into their first year so whilst the academy they're allocated at different training centers around the state upon graduation they will transfer to those training stations within those stations are a number of field training officers who will then for a first year Constable that is a 12-month period their first two months is 100 supervision and then after that two months is 50 supervision through that period of time there's a number of workplace activities that they need to meet the requirements of and at the end of that 18 months having collectively successfully passed everything they'll then be confirmed and be fully operational police officer that can work without supervision we certainly try and highlight to recruits that being a member of this organization there is an expectation by the community of showing leadership and being looked upon to be a leader and we very much value our development of people as leaders in the organization [Music] foreign", "text_to_speech_word_count": 562,
