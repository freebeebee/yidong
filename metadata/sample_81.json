no more rolling around so this is what we're going to do we're going to learn how to duck an ankle but we're gonna start kind of in this leg path position he's gonna lay flat okay he's gonna dive through he's gonna back cook okay on his left side the American left all right good right so as opposed to the New Mexico left right so I'm in this position and again I'm gonna act like I just got passed to my right and I'm gonna duck to the right but my mechanics are way different but they're highly effective so when I go to duck to the right side I'm diving out and I'm attacking the sock so I'm not just continuing to roll to my right toes are in the mat knees are under me I'm diving out here CIO and got my chest to his heel now my mechanics or to duck this ankle not rolled to my right so I'm on my right hip right shoulder my heel is gonna come to my butt and I'm gonna do this little AB curl break dance move under his leg if I see this movement I'm not just picking his foot up I am crunching my abs and when shall I bring my body under his leg see how his leg is over my top shoulder and I still have two hands to it so this is gonna be the drill he's gonna die between your legs back hook your right foot you're gonna dive out to your right shoulder and your right hip okay or your left shoulder and your left hip it doesn't matter your heels gonna come to your butt you're gonna windshield wiper your body under his leg as you bring it over your top shoulder so your heels going to come to your you're gonna winch your wife for your body you're gonna get your butt back to your heels you're gonna dive out you're gonna winch your wife or your body under over and over and over again you see how I'm making this nice little looks like a car window when it's raining right making a windshield wiper motion here and I'm getting the wraps this is the most crucial part of my ankle duct okay this position here I don't want you to do anything after it but in a match but once your wiper and sit up there's no more rolling around for this guy all I got to do is get my chest over my feet and I'm in great shape right here okay so this ankle duck position is going to make guys that kind of know how to pass legs and roll around I'm gonna end all that nonsense so do it just like I just did don't sit up don't do anything dive out two ants to it but to your heel or heel to your butt
