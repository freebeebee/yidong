Groundbreaking. I think unique, but in some ways, probably, uh, didn\u2019t go as intended.\u201d \u201cGlacier was a short lived WCW Superstar.\u201d \u201cWho is Glacier?\u2019 \u201cOh yeah, did he pass away?\u201d I remember sitting on the edge of the ring saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever gonna be good at this, but I\u2019ve just found what makes me freaking come alive. you know and I\u2019ve gotta pursue this with everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d What made Glacier this athlete who too many people regard as a joke or bad, like, what made it not work? Glacier was a mortal combat character brought to life. WCW was looking for a more diverse palette of characters so there had to be someone who was willing to take the risk and say, let\u2019s see if this works. We\u2019ll dive all in. And when the president of the company says, we\u2019re gonna throw all this money into it, I mean, who wouldn\u2019t say yes to that? Bischoff was a bit of a visionary there, he was just about 20 years too early. It didn\u2019t matter who was in that Glacier gimmick, the fans wouldn\u2019t have liked him because of the build-up we had. He also may have been the first victim of receiving a really huge hype, where maybe creative in other things wasn\u2019t uh, fully tee\u2019d up for. We put so much time, and money, into trying to make that character work, you know, you have to do that if you really want to get a character over, the bad news is, is that when, when it slips and falls, it hits with a really big thud, and sometimes that thud, resonates for a long long time. I came back for one of my colleagues football games and I ran into one of my former coaches, he said, \u201cwhat are you doing these days?\u201d And I told him I was teaching school and I was stil\u2026and I knew what I was excited to say, I\u2019m still pursuing professional wrestling, and it\u2019s going pretty good right now. And just this look on his face was, a look of like, like, kinda shocked. And he said, \u201care you really still pursuing that, crap?\" And I remember it was like someone had punched me in the stomach. To me it was like, he didn\u2019t believe that that was something I could be doing or should be doing. There was not one person in there that expected Glacier to come in, and then the music hit, and everybody lost their mind. I didn\u2019t know what kind of crowd would be there, I didn\u2019t know if I would be received well, I didn\u2019t know if I would get laughed out of the place. Over the 21 years I\u2019ve been able do proudly to the gimmick and still be Glacier, the thousands upon thousands of people who have told me how much they enjoyed it, that\u2019s what I kind of hang my hat on. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still taking bumps, that blows me away. A lot of the guys around here can\u2019t even walk to sit down, and he\u2019s still taking bumps after all these years.\u201d I\u2019ve been training a lot because I had hip replacement 2 years ago. And now I\u2019m at the point where I feel like, I can do, with limitations I can do a lot in the ring now. He\u2019s still Glacier, he\u2019s still amazing. Most respectful, and caring cats I\u2019ve ever met. He doesn\u2019t forget the people that helped him get to this spot. It\u2019s the man and the character that means something to me. The critics of the Glacier gimmick. I get it to a certain degree, but the world is going to be full of people that tell you what you can\u2019t do. You just gotta let those people not rent space in your head. Because they will, if you let them. Glacier, uh, is an outstanding human being, one of my dearest friends. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the paycheck, you know? I don\u2019t do it today for the money anyway. I mean, I never did, but it\u2019s more about, getting out there, getting back to the fans. You know, at 53 years old I don't have to be doing this, but, I love it, and it\u2019s just where my heart is. You know, if you want to see what I can do, tell me what I can\u2019t do. Cause life\u2019s 10% of what happens to you, and 90% how you react to it. You can always, always, always, control how you react to it. There was not one single time that I remember, putting my feet on the pull, and saying, \u201coh god I gotta go do this again today.\u201d And I wish every person could experience what that feels like. Just them them know, you know what, I\u2019m doing this because I love it. It is something that, I will never ever forget. I\u2019m sorry, I just, I never can tell it without tearing up, \u2018cause man, it was just an awesome \u2018cause man, it was just an awesome experience.", "text_to_speech_word_count": 854, "timecoded_text_to_speech": [{"end": "00:00:14.598", "start": "00:00:00.000", "text": " Glacier to me is many things ground breaking.
