Kurt even the atmosphere within the band changed Kurt stopped talking to band mates Chris and D Groll no one was very happy with the tour or the band even Buzz Osborne from the Melvin's aired rumors of Kurt wanting out and did you know Courtney stirred controversy by claiming Kurt left a farewell note just weeks before his death stay tuned as we dive into the events that led to Kurt's breakdown in Rome on March 4th before his actual death a month later he was very apologetic no no no I'm sorry it's a big mistake was drink the champagne and in Rome just made a mistake this incident was unfortunately overlooked by his friends and [Music] family in February 1994 the band went on a big tour in Europe which was said to be their last one together because Buzz Osborne who was touring with Nirvana at the time mentioned that Kurt was planning to break up the the band soon during that time Kurt was having a tough time he couldn't find what he usually took in Europe which led to him suffer from withdrawal while on tour he was also feeling homesick missing his wife and daughter and the stress of touring was affecting his health and mood additionally there was tension in the band Kurt wasn't talking to Christ and Dave Gro and the only band member he was still communicating with was Pat smear we've made a detailed video about Pat so be sure to watch it later according to the book I found my friends the band's mood changed during their last tour shifting from excitement to a very negative atmosphere this was because Nirvana was performing identical 1 and a half hour shows every night and Kurt was constantly complaining of illness boredom and feeling old at this stage being in Nana was no longer enjoyable for the members they had contracts and obligations and stopping could leave to legal trouble Nirvana had become like a cash cow that needed to earn money for others and Kurt hated [Music] it originally the tour was supposed to last for 3 months covering the whole of Europe until April 8th however it ended early with their last concert on March 1st this final show took place in an old airplane hanger called Terminal 1 in Germany in front of around 3,000 people the place wasn't fancy and the sound quality was bad curring magazine mentioned that the band seemed uninterested and according to writer Charles cross Kurt Cobain skipped the sound check asking the tour manager for money instead and went to the train station probably to score additionally before the concert in Munich Kurt had a fight over the phone with his wife he even talked to his lawyer about wanting a divorce according to the book Nirvana FAQ by John luren at the show Nirvana started with a cover of the Cars track My Best Friend's Girl which might have been hinting at his troubles with his wife Courtney Love a few songs into their set nurana play Come As You Are you are be there's a friend take but then the power went out when it came back back on they were supposed to play snells Like Teen Spirit but skipped it as they often did this time basist Christ novas selich made a joke or possibly foreshadowed the future on the way out is dead is over Pat smear mentioned to the guardian that Kurt's voice became more trashed with every song his voice was so gone but instead of trying to conserve it Kurt seemed to enjoy pushing it to the [Music] [Applause] limit which brings

told their agent Don Mueller in backstage that's it it's over indicating the tour was finished the very next day a doctor diagnosed him with laryngitis and bronchitis at that moment Gro headed home but Kurt and Pat smear who reportedly was the only one in the band that Cobain was on talking terms with headed to Rome to meet courtne love and Francis Bean by March 3rd Kurt was in Rome Italy but unfortunately this trip would cast a long Shadow over the following weeks Courtney told Rolling Stone in December 1994 that she was away for 40 days with her band hole when she got a call from Kurt ke was crying and in a dark place he was finding it hard to cope with Fame and his personal issues I don't think Kurt wanted to be a huge rock star and uh I don't think he could handle how complicated it had all become hearing this Courtney decided to drop everything and go to Rome to be with him on their last evening together before the incident Kurt and Courtney had a quiet night with room service and a rare bottle of champagne the next morning March 4th Courtney woke up at about 5:30 a.m. and found Kurt unresponsive on the floor near their bed Courtney said that Kurt had taken 50 tablets along with the remaining bottle from the night before she quickly called the hotel's front desk for help and an ambulance took Kurt to Umberto Polyclinic [Music] Hospital hi I'm tabi the saurin with MTV News Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was hospitalized in a coma in Rome Italy on Friday morning Pat smear accompanied him to the hospital in the Foo Fighters documentary back forth he recounted his dilemma about being torn between announcing Kurt as a VIP to ensure immediate care or or downplaying his identity to avoid attracting media attention I finally went with this is kirain um VIP do something about it there doctors emptied his stomach he was then transferred to Rome American Hospital where he woke up a few hours later 27-year-old singer was back to normal and doing fine doctors have said that cabain would not suffer any permanent damage news got better Saturday when Cain regained consciousness the doctor said Cain's recovery was in part due to the quick thinking of his wife some people thought this event was just another event in Kurt's history of misuse while Courtney and those close to him saw it as a clear indication of what would happen later she mentioned a note he left that said Dr Baker says I would have to choose between life and death I'm choosing death whether the incident was accidental remains unclear Kurt management and the Doctor Who treated him suggested it was unintentional the doctor who cared for him at the hospital disagreed with Courtney's claim of fify pills as detailed in the book Love and Death suggesting that the circumstances didn't appear intentional to him given his typical experience with such cases so who do you think is telling the truth the doctors or the wife please share your thoughts in the comments below every
